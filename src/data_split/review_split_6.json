                "The small issue I had with occasional pointer stuttering my finger movement using the track pad appears to have gone away - now operates smoothly following finger moments when pointing and scrolling, but replaced with one where on a few sites when attempting to scroll using the arrow keys it doesn't - not sure it's a laptop problem or a site problem, and if the arrow keys don't work, the track pad scrolling does",
                "For my main uses of web surfing, with a few tabs on my Firefox browser open - often using Google search and Google Maps, receiving/sending email, and WeChat conversations, it's every bit as good as my Lenovo Ideapad with it's much more powerful Intel Core I7 Processor",
                "Overall, I'm still very 5 star happy with this laptop given it's excellent screen display, speed in loading and using apps, lite-weight and low purchase price."
