                "While the brand might not have the kudos of more familiar ones this is a surprisingly well-finished product",
                "It\u2019s nicely designed, slimline and importantly doesn\u2019t feel cheap and works well",
                "The screen is bright and clear and the trackpad is responsive (cursor sensitivity wise and also the pinch/expand/reduce function)",
                "This particular model comes with 4gb of RAM which doesn\u2019t sound much (it isn\u2019t) but still sufficient to run all the applications without any noticeable lag (there is another model around the same price that comes with 6gb RAM but without a year\u2019s office 365 thrown in - and I would go for that one unless you need Office)",
                "It fires up quite quickly and Windows 10 runs as it should",
                "This model comes with a UK keyboard overlay: I was expecting this to look/feel a little disappointing but in fact once in it fits that well you won\u2019t even notice it (and it\u2019s a nice keyboard to type on - responsive and quiet)",
                "I\u2019ve used this laptop for most purposes and so far I\u2019ve found it reliable and generally a pleasure to use",
                "Sure, it\u2019s not going to blow you away performance wise (and as for games you may as well forget it)",
                "But for general browsing,leisure (iPlayer, YouTube etc) and school/university use this is perfectly adequate",
                "In short, if you want a nice budget laptop that does the basics well - look no further",
                "Recommended."
