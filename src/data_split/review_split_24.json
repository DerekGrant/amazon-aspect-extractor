                ":( She told me that this one is great, as it is nice and responsive compared to her last one and the keys are comfortable for prolonged use",
                "There is no '@' or '\u00a3' symbols on the actual keyboard, but it is the right command when each button is pressed and not what is shown on these keys",
                "The Laptop did actually come with an included free, soft key cover, which was a nice bonus, that does have the right symbols marked on it, so no real foul and it was great to see they were concerned and catered to the customer",
                "My Sister told me that it has a quick charge battery, which is always good and also that it has a good camera for meetings and video use, which she is having to use more, no due to working a lot from home",

                "For the money I think this a fantastic, high-quality, compact, entry-level laptop and its perfect for your everyday use",
                "It comes well packaged in a mostly plain brown box and with the laptop you get a 2m power cable with UK plug, silicone/rubber keyboard cover to change the layout to UK, and a 1-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal (worth \u00a360 or \u00a35.99 a month on its own)",
                "The laptop has a 13.3\u201d 1080p 60hz display, Celeron N3350 Processor (mine boosts to 2.3GHz), 4GB RAM (3.85GB usable), 64GB Hard Drive (56.6GB real capacity), and Windows 10 Home 64-bit installed",
                "The design of the laptop is very stylish and its pleasing to look at",
                "Its lightweight yet its looks and feels very good quality, the screen or keyboard have very little flex to them, and the hinge feel smooth and should stand up to the test of time well",
                "There are four large rubber feet which provide excellent grip when placed on a surface, the large trackpad features an integrated left and right mouse button, and there are blue LEDs along the top of the keyboard to show the power status, caps lock, and whether the touchpad is disabled",
                "There is a removable cover underneath to install a M.2 SSD, the screw for my cover has been rounded off, I assume this was done by a machine at the factory so hopefully just a one off",
                "The keys are good quality, nicely spaced and have just the right amount of travel to them",
                "The included cover which gives you a UK layout (as long as its selected in the Region options in Windows) feels softer to type on but I prefer the responsiveness of the keys without it on and I\u2019m used to typing on a US layout anyway",
                "The trackpad responds well to touch and while I\u2019m not the biggest fan of using them I didn\u2019t come across any problems with this one and I like the integrated mouse buttons",
                "The performance is excellent considering the cost of the laptop, it will handle any general task you throw at it and its ideal for use alongside your main computer when your away from it or it makes for the perfect entry to a Windows PC if you don\u2019t want to spend too much money",
                "It cold boots to the desktop in around 55 seconds and takes 3-5 seconds when launching Edge or Office programs for the first time which is very respectable",
                "It can be a little slow when loading content heavy websites like YouTube but once loaded it can play 4k video just fine and wireless internet speeds are good giving me a download of 72Mbps and upload of 43Mbps with full signal when running a speed test",
                "The onboard graphics are powered by Intel HD 500",
                "The display and sound are both very good",
                "The screen is bright and the images are colourful and sharp, you don\u2019t get any glare on the screen if there is a light is behind you and the viewing angle is acceptable if your sharing the screen with someone",
                "The sound is more than good enough, there are two speakers on the underside which can be turned up to a decent volume, I\u2019ve had worse speakers on laptops that cost a lot more than this, you can easily watch a movie/video or listen to music using them and I\u2019m happy with the way they sound",
                "The battery life isn\u2019t too shabby, I seem to get consistent results of around 3 hours use when using it for browsing the internet and watching videos, this is using it in Best Performance mode and with the screen brightness set to 100%",
                "I\u2019m sure you could get an extra hour or so from it if you use a more battery efficient setting",
                "Overall, I really can\u2019t fault this machine given the cost and how useable it is",
                "It can be a little sluggish sometimes, but it\u2019s done everything I\u2019ve asked from it and I haven\u2019t got frustrated with it once so that\u2019s always a good thing",
                "Its excellent to travel with and feels well-made so hopefully it should hold up well",
                "With an Office subscription included I think this is an excellent package to get you started out in a Windows computer environment and it\u2019s a product I definitely recommend",
                "I feel this is well worth the full five stars!"

The laptop was simplicity itself to set up, as you just follow the onscreen instructions",
                "Windows 10 runs very well on the laptop, which though it doesn\u2019t have the speediest processor, it is perfectly adequate for what you need for office or School work in my view",
                "Of course this laptop has very little storage, but with 1TB on OneDrive and multiple other cloud options available, you really don\u2019t need it, and you have the added bonus of all your files being backed up and available across all you devices",

                "It has a lot of pros and cons but it's fully functional and most importantly affordable for a price of a tablet you can have a full functional Laptop (at time of this review the laptop cost \u00a3203)",
                "Arrived in a brown box with the Laptop securely located between four plastic foam cradles to protect from any damage",

                "After I took it out of the box, I've immediately realised why is this laptop so cheap?! The biggest shock for me it was the charger, I'm not joking it looks like the AC adapter from my Charisma tree light",
                "The other thing that makes this laptop very cheap is the built quality, although it is advertised that it has an aluminium body but I think it\u2019s only the top side is aluminium the bottom part is plastic",
                "Unfortunately, the lid can't be lifted by one finger and it's a little but flimsy so I would recommend to open it up from the middle part",

                "It's pretty basic but you don't need more for everyday use",
                "The 13.3\" screen surprisingly nice and sharp with the 1920x1080 resolution, has really good colours and it's bright enough to use it indoor and outdoor too",
                "What\u2019s inside? the laptop is driven by an Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core processor (Single Core Burst, Multi-Core Burst max 2.3 GHz) which was primarily designed for inexpensive notebooks",
                "Comes with 4GB DDR3 Ram and 64GB eMMC storage which is not much (again another reason why it's a cheap laptop) but it can be extended up to 1TB SSD or with max 256Gb microSD card",
                "It comes Pre installed Microsoft Windows and after a few steps of activation process you will also get a full year of Microsoft 365 Personal subscription",
                "The laptop performs well for everyday use such like browsing internet, using Office, watching movie etc",
                "It's very quiet thanks to no fan installed into the laptop",
                "Battery life is very impressive, I managed to get 5-6 hours of moderate use out of this 4500mAh battery and then to fully charged it takes just 1.5-2 hours which is great, I think",
                "Overall, I think this is a great budget laptop",
                "For a price of 10\" tablet you can buy this laptop with bigger screen and keyboard, great for doing basic staff, for travel, for business, for study or as a first laptop for kids."

                "Basic though reliable and good value for money - perfect school laptop.",
                "I did try to upload a video with detailed overview of the laptop, but it did not go through, so here is the long(ish) narrative to explain what my view of this little unit is: 1",
                "It is a tiny little thing that is easy to carry around as not only is it slim and small, but lightweight too; 2",
                "Despite its fragile appearance, it is a robust little thing, as my daughter knocked it off her bed a few times, and granted it only landed on her plush carpet, it still survived the fall both times, so the insides must be robust and the screen sturdy; 3",
                "it is good-looking and the screen quality is surprisingly good - I have recently reviewed an inexpensive monitor, so can compare like for like - this one is on a par with far more expensive laptops when it comes to the visual produced - it is crystal clear, no pix-elation anywhere, no blurriness, sharp focus, vivid bright colors, etc",
                "4",
                "It has Microsoft suite included -as far as I understand there is a 9 month subscription and that on its own is a third of the price you pay for the laptop itself, so you are actually getting the device at a reduced price anyhow, if you count the cost of the software in..",
                "we stopped the subscription for my daughter, and saved in access of seventy quid immediately; 5",
                "It is perfect for all sorts of basic school work, as it is the case in my family, and as its processing power is not that great, you cannot run twenty thousand applications all at once, so it is brilliant when trying to ensure your kid DOES work and not pretends to multitask by watching films, browsing the net, chatting to their mates , playing games AND typing their school work in all at once! It just will be so slow that the kid will have to choose which of the host of activities should take priority! 6",
                "The mouse pad is sensitive and on a par with my expensive machines 7",
                "It is a bit slow when booting up, but once up and running - it meets all your basic needs in quite an effective fashion",
                "8",
                "it is a perfect laptop for a school kid and is such a must-have at the time of the increased focus on home learning",
                "We have used it for a month now and my daughter has not complained once! This is her fourth computer and the cheapest one too so she has a lot to compare it to...still...no moaning."
