["GREAT CASUAL USER LAPTOP. Ok, just to get everything out in one sentence: This is the perfect laptop for the CASUAL laptop user! Which is a good thing! This is a great little laptop! for $200 this is a steal. 64 gigabytes is enough for windows 10. If you get a 128GB mini SD card, then this laptop will work great for you. Now if you plan on using this to store pictures, videos and other files, for awhile, then you will run out of space (with the laptop alone). But with a mini SD card or a flash drives to store your files, you'll be fine. If you are a heavy computer user and need it for heavy video editing, photoshop or a heavy gamer, then obviously this won't work for you. I use windows movie maker. It works just fine. This can play light games or games that have been released from the early 2000's (if you play on Steam).. Newer games that need Gforce and what not.. Obviously not. This laptop is for the casual user, but can hold its grounds when using other programs. I have used adobe elements for video editing.. Does it work. yes, it does! is it the best computer to use it on.. haha, no. But it does work on this laptop, though this isn't the idea computer you'd used a program on like this. But if you're on a tight budget and don't mind the laptop taking a few extra moments to process everything, then go for it. The keyboard and the mouse pad works like butter. I love typing on this thing. I've typed on several 11.6\" laptops and had trouble, but I have no problem typing on this. GREAT LAPTOP and VERY HAPPY!!",
"Top Choice in this segment. This is the only ultra-book I could find with a 64gb ssd, 4gb RAM, weighed only 2 pounds (actually 2.1) and cost $200. If your expectations are reasonable (i.e. don't expect to find a large screen, don't expect to run intense programs or games) then I think you will be happy with this. The notebook comes with Windows 10S (not windows 10) which can be upgraded free and easily. If the upgrade is not made, then you are limited to the programs/apps in windows' store which is not very comprehensive. The only issue here is that the Windows 10 version the upgrade goes to is 64 bit (not 32) which has compatibility issues with some older programs. I found the eMMC disk drive to be fast, the computer boots in a few seconds. There is a Micro SD slot. 256GB micro sd card is only around $25 and is immensely helpful in increasing available storage (buy a name brand only; i.e. microcenter, sandisk, pny, crucial, kingston, etc etc). The internal eMMC drive or the RAM can not be upgraded. WiFi is strong, the screen is only 11.5\" but is very bright and has very good resolution and color. The USB ports are V 3.x. The keyboard does not feel cramped or compromised in any way despite the small size of the notebook. Too bad it does not have a trackpoint which would be very helpful in navigating more precisely on the small screen. I have only had this so far for a week so I can not comment on durability. The card slot seems a bit flimsy. I have been unable to get anything near the \"whole day\" claim on a battery charge. 6 hours is about it but obviously that is still very good. Overall I believe this is a very good choice especially for this price range; this laptop is not much heavier than a tablet but is much more useful. Also, Windows 10 is far more versatile than the Chrome OS, in my opinion anyway.",
"Linux mighty mouse at a great price!. I bought this on Prime day to replace an android tablet. Wanted something a little more capable, yet portable. I installed several Linux distros without a hitch. Settled on Mint 19. It's rock stable and runs smooth as butter. I added a 200gb micro sd for data storage and have a 2 tb slim USB HD for more extensive things like video. I haven't found much that this mighty mouse will not do. If you need am inexpensive portable Linux machine, look no further. All you kind folks having winows problems on this laptop, save yourself a boat load of headaches and jump off the Microsoft bandwagon. Try linux. Mint is a great place to start. It will easily handle your web, office and email. I have even edited photos with the (free) equivalent of Photoshop and Lightroom ... GIMP and Darktable. I understand that there is a place for Windows et al on a more capable machine, but for something this light and portable I have not found a better way to go.",
"Inaccurate description. I was sent an L203MA. From the first moment, the touchpad was weird. It only was accurate when I started the curser when my finger was 1/2 inch from base of the track pad. Now that may have fixable software problem, but the downloaded driver files specific to this model would not work with it as recommended by ASUS as a possible fix. Now that problem was nothing compared to my main complaint. The From the manufacturer description in Amazon said that this model came with a backlit keyboard. In the ASUS FAQ and later confirmed by the ASUS Chat representative, it did not. I am returning this unit today. I have never given a one star rating and am doing this to make sure that others be aware of the inaccurate description provided in the item\u2019s description.",
"Zips Right Along. I really, really like this little gizmo. Looks good, feels as solid as one can expect, nice response feel on the keys, crisp display and bright, and lightning fast... for a reason. First things first, I ripped Windows out of this mini laptop shortly after powering it up. Why? Windows is a memory and resource hog. Secondly, the amount of information they want just to run the laptop outside Windows S mode is ridiculous. Hence, Windows had to go, so it I took it out. In place of Windows I installed Manjaro Linux, based off the Arch Linux distro, using the Xcfe interface system. Both are considered light weight and just seemed perfect for this mini laptop. The OS slid right in without a single problem, it picked up all the hardware on boot-up, and the response times proved better than I hoped. As a test of the battery, I loaded up Youtube with 15 hours of videos and let it run. After nearly exhausting the 15 hours of videos, the laptop battery finally gave up. It impressed me since it played for 14 hours and 27 minutes non-stop. Moreover, the speakers sounded much better than I thought they would. A little tinny, but what could anyone really expect? The laptop never got too warm, either, considering it is a fanless system. It just powered through without a hiccup. After ten days of regular use it seems rock solid. The shakedown period ran without a hitch. The distro comes with automatic updates, so the OS is kept fresh and update. The WiFi range is quite good. I remained connected to my WiFi for just about fifty feet, and the signal needed to pass through walls. The camera is okay, but to be honest I do not use it much if at all. I simply tested it. At just over two pounds, it travels well in my backpack and I use it during my commutes to and from the office. LibreOffice runs like a champ. GIMP runs like a champ. Audicty runs like a champ. KPatience is quick and fun. Firefox with extensions is incredibly fast... faster than on my main desktop. This is a great little mini laptop and, with the Manjaro OS changes, is worth more than purchase price. I highly recommend it since it proved so amenable to modification. I would definitely buy again. 6 Months Later... I still love this mini-laptop. I use it almost every day. Mostly I use it for writing, streaming music to a Bluetooth speaker, and a little web surfing, and I could not be happier with this machine. I made the right choice of swapping out the OS. I have recommended it to others, and I know of at least 3 other people who purchased one. They also seemed pleased, but I don't want to speak directly for them.",
"Pleasantly surprised and imprressed. I bought the ASUS Vivo book to replace an HP Stream I purchased at a local chain. As an author, albeit not well-known, I use a laptop primarily for writing. I also create my own graphics and maintain my website. The Stream quickly ran out of storage space, making it a constant (weekly) endeavor to free up space. Then - the death knoll. Not enough space to update Windows 10, and Microsoft would no longer offer service or support for my version of 10. I was unfamiliar with ASUS, having located the Vivo on Amazon. The specs were sufficient for my needs. The bonus of Office 365 for a year was a plus as a 19-year user of Office. Slim and lightweight, easy to carry. Graphics are good, as is sound and compatibility with my desktop. The most impressive feature to me? Power on to ready to use is 10 seconds. The Stream took 30-45 and my aging desktop - up to 2 minutes. For $190 dollars, I am as pleased as I've ever been with a laptop/notebook. I'm even getting used to Windows 10, and I love the Cloud storage. I would recommend to someone on a budget or if your looking for a fast and efficient laptop/notebook, (a pretty nice option)&gt;",
"Warning! Stopped working after two days!. Would give this item 0 stars if possible- needed a small travel computer for a trip I was taking- thought this would be perfect in place of outdated Chromebook I had previously. Received it in seemingly new condition- used it for two days and tried to turn it on on the day we were leaving, and NOTHING- wouldn't charge, turn on, ZERO. (yes, I tried all the tricks) Thankfully was able to run to UPS to return for a full refund (thanks Amazon Prime!), and picked up a slightly larger device (from a different manufacturer) at Best Buy.",
"Play WoW at work!. I bought this laptop to leave at work so I can log on to World of Warcraft during my lunch break everyday and work on my character(s) professions. (I installed WoW on a MicroSD card since the 64GB internal drive is not enough room.) I was skeptical WoW would even run, but it does! I turn all the graphics settings all the way down, and get anywhere from 10-45 FPS in the open world, and 5-15 FPS in the cities. This might be my best purchase ever! I cannot wait for WoW Classic!",
"Great unit, but I got a lemon. (It Happens). &nbsp;ASUS makes great products and when it comes to electronics every now and then you get one that doesn't work. This was my case.. The instruction manual recommends charging for at least 3 hours before running it off the battery alone. I let it charge for close to four hours and it said it was 100% fully charged. BUT when I unpluged the power cord the unit shut right off. And it would not start up unless I plug the power cord back in. I'm guessing the battery was bad or something along those lines.. Anyways, While I had it plugged in and powered up it seemed to be really nice... It was fast. Setup was easy. It has an excellent display and sound. I have nothing negative to say about this laptop other than the one I received was a lemon and would not power up unless it was plugged in. I ended up returning it the next day and ordered a different laptop. later I'll probably order another one of these, hopefully getting one that works right and I'll do a proper tech review on it.",
"Perfect portable typing and research station. Wow wow wow. I can't find enough good things to say about this portable powerhouse. I'm a pretty hardcore gamer who also uses a lot of graphics intensive programs like Photoshop and Unreal 4. This laptop... is not for that. It's for those times away from your high-end programs, where you need 10 chrome tabs open in a coffee shop while you're experimenting with Microsoft Word layouts. It's for when you're out in the woods and want to sort and organize the photos on your camera's SD right then and there. It's for trips where you want to travel light, but still want the world at your finger tips. OK, OK, enough flowery language. Let's get to the pros / cons: Pros: -The keyboard feels great, with a nice balance of being chunky and \"clicky\" while still being compact. Once you get used to its size, it's pretty easy to get close to your fastest typing speeds with minimal errors. -This thing is really light. Maybe I'm too sued to heavier laptops, but seriously, this thing is effortless to bring around. Throw it in a backpack, tuck it under your shoulder, do whatever. This thing is pretty durable from what I can tell, so all that lightness doesn't come at the cost of having to gingerly secure it in a special compartment. Any ol' laptop bag / pocket will do! -The battery life is great! Maybe I'm too used to being tethered to outlets by more power-hungry machines, but I was able to get hours of typing and Chromeing out of this thing. The key I've found (as with most machines) is to keep the brightness a bit low when you're not plugged it, it can make a big difference. -ASUS has always made my favorite laptops and this one is no exception. If you're a fan of ASUS' work, you'll find everything you know and love about and ASUS packed into a tiny package. -The ports, lordy, the ports! So many ports in such a tiny machine. -The screen is far brighter and more colorful than I was expecting. My other laptop is a \"state-of-the-art\" ROG Strix II, with a high color accuracy, high refresh-rate display... the issue is they never calibrate said displays and they always end up coming out sickly yellow, requiring hours of manual adjusting. Not this little fighter though! Bright and beautiful right out of the box! Color pureists will notice things can get a bit washed out, but it's certainly preferable to the yellow tint of other machines. -The price is the best I've seen for the quality of machine you're getting. This thing is durable, sturdy and built for a few specific things it excels at. It's definitely given my productivity a boost and is well worth the investment. -There was pretty minimal bloatware on the machine, which was great. -Office 360 for a year is a HUGE plus. Also be sure to upgrade the machine to full Windows 10 (from S), the process is free, fast and jarringly painless. Cons: -Even 64 GBs is not a a huge amount of space. This is definitely more of a document and cloud oriented device. If you're hoping to put your entire music library on this thing you're going to need to expand the storage. If storage isn't an issue, than this is probably the book for you! -Similarly the 4 GBs of RAM can make this little engine chug sometimes. Don't expect it to be happy with running 20 chrome tabs at once,n or for it to instantly load pages the moment you click them. It's certainly fast enough, but as someone who's coming from a 16 GB machine the little differences can be noticeable. -The touch pad is ... OK. It's not terrible, but (much like all touch pads these days) it loses tracking now and then and lacks any real buttons for the left and right. I never much enjoyed touch pads to begin with so maybe I'm biased. Closing thoughts: If you like what you've read, read more reviews and honestly take the dive. If you're looking for a durable portable typer, that can do a little bit of everything this is your machine! More closing thoughts: A story for you, about ASUS laptops... In winter I got an ROG Strix II, a very powerful and very pricey machine. It was maddening getting the thing to work properly. Getting photoshop to play nice with the dual graphics. Getting the screen to not look yellow. Getting the damn speakers to not crank the bass. Many of these issues are still unresolved and frankly though I love the hardware I'm more than likely going to have to start from square one with that thing. I was all emotionally prepared to go through the same process with this little trail-blazer. I was ready to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and finally get something that mostly did what I needed. To my absolute delight, this machine seems to be the last bastion of PCs that do everything right, everything the way they're supposed to, right out of the box. I haven't had to troubleshoot a single thing about this beautiful laptop and honestly couldn't be happier. If you're looking for something portable, something durable, something to up your productivity and most of all something easy to work with, this is the laptop for you.",
"NIGHTMARE. What a nightmare. Wasted about 5 hours tonight between amazon support and ASUS support. DO NOT buy the amazon warehouse deal. Mine didn\u2019t include Office 365 and when I called ASUS I was told that a previous owner of this device had already used up the office 365 one year free trial that was assigned to my computer\u2019s serial number. On top of that, windows won\u2019t activate due to not having a valid digital license or product key. Even after going through a full factory reset, it\u2019s still not working. Have been back and forth with support all night and now ASUS support system is down and all they can tell me is to try calling back another time. In the meantime, this computer still doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m about ready to office space this piece of crap and go buy something else. I will never buy a computer from anyone but the manufacturer ever again.",
"Heavily dissapointed. I ordered this at the beginning of August 2019, and when I received my order, I saw the laptop and thought \"oh great, this will be useful and handy this year for school.\" It's not a big laptop or anything or very fancy, but its description suited me as a low-income student. Then I tried to use the laptop, only to find out that the version of Windows 10s that was supposed to be on the laptop was a bootlegged version, which heavily affected the usability of my laptop. I have now returned said laptop, but with all the hassle that comes with this, please don't get it. Spare yourself whatever pain.",
"Horrible Piece of Junk. Worst purchase ever and experience ever, less than a month after I purchased this PC for my son the power supply died and ASUS refused to replace it. They said I had to send them back the $5.00 power supply before they would replace it. I Had to buy another power supply just to get the PC up and running. After I sent the power supply back they claimed that they never got it. Now mind you the defective power supply was just being shipped across town. The claimed they never got it and that I was responsible to provide them a tracking number. So let me see if I understand this, you want me to spend about $20.00 for shipping and a tracking number to replace a $5.00 power supply. I figured they would just get it since they service center is in Pomona California and not in China. They claim they never got it. Now 7 month later the whole computer is dead. Will not power up, screen is dead yet the Hard Drive light is on. ASUS answer, send the computer back to them and if they determine it was not dropped or abused they might repair it. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A GOOD COMPUTER. THIS THING IS A PIECE OF JUNK AND NOW I AM OUT ABOUT $200.00 Fortunately I purchased an extended warranty, Unfortunately the extended warranty doesn't go into effect until after this junk warranty expires. Amazon wont do anything other than refer me to ASUS, ASUS tells me I am $H@% out of luck. My only recourse now is to file a complaint with the BBB and take them to small claims court. Horrible Horrible experience. Never again DON'T BY ASUS PRODUCTS, THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS .",
"Poor Performance -Not Reliable!. I bought for my son for homeschooling during COVID-19 School closure. In the middle of lessons the computer shuts down. We\u2019re only using google classroom and educational applications. Note: This laptop doesn\u2019t have a touch screen. I don\u2019t think it will work well over time since it keeps shutting down and giving me an error screen. I do not recommend this computer. I need something of better quality. Amazon didn\u2019t help me with the error, they sent me ASUS and I have not heard back. My son needs to complete online exams and I can\u2019t trust this computer.",
"Chromebook Compromise Worth Making. I rather foolishly gave up my very capable Lenovo Thinkpad for a massive HP Omen when I committed to getting rid of my console gaming systems. And love my 17in Omen as I do, I'm damned if that thing is going to travel with me anywhere I need to get some kind of work done when on vacation. Most of my work is cloud based, so I don't need a whole mess of hardware to run what I do. I like Chromebooks, but I did miss the Microsoft ecosystem when I used them, I found. This little thing looks to be just the niche I needed. It's dead small; I carry it around with my iPad Pro for editing photos and videos, and together they almost vanish in a bag. The battery life is pretty spectacular for the work I do on the regular. I did try, just for fun, putting some Photoshop and Lightroom projects on it, just to see how it handled them; eh - better than I thought, but definitely wouldn't recommend. Maybe in a pinch, but I wouldn't lean too heavily on it. The track pad is nothing special. I did eventually concede and buy a wireless mouse to use with it whilst on vacation, but that's probably down to my impatience on certain things. It was definitely better than some trackpads I've used, but nothing like my old Lenovo...(moment of silence for Thinky) All in all, though, I would recommend this to anyone for whom a Chromebook is a viable solution, but doesn't always go where constant connectivity is possible, so local word processing is a must. BTW, I can't really speak to how the Vivobook runs and works in S mode, like it comes out of the gate. I needed some applications that the store doesn't supply, so I switched out of it almost immediately. But I don't doubt it would work just fine, if not even faster. But I never grew fond of Internet Explorer, or the newer browser, so S mode had to go. Even so, 5/5, would highly recommend - just know what you need it for, and if it can meet those requirements. With those in mind, this'll probably do you just fine \ud83d\udc4d",
"please dont buy this crap it is a total rip off. I ordered this item because it was very slim and light weight and had an average review. I made a big mistake. It is totally bad and useless. There is no battery that works inside the computer. The computer worked for 10 minutes while it was charging. then it wen toff and the battery will not charge and thelaptop will not even start with Ac cable It is a total disgrace for Amazon to sell this product.",
"One litle Power House !. Ok, so you're tired of carrying around the 100 plus pound laptop when you go on vacation or need to make a presentation. Well, I was there too. This 11.6 in screen ASUS Vivobook L203MA 2 + lbs laptop is great ! It's similar in size to a Chrombook but this has Windows10 home. It's in \"S\" mode (safe) which protects you from outside attacks. The downfall on that is that you're going to want to add some of your programs which will require you to remove the system out of \"S\" mode. (super easy). One important thing.... I highly recommended spending a little more $ to get the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage model.. It's going to cost a little more but highly recommended !! I also bought along with this a wireless mouse. I also recommended the Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub with Individual LED Power Switches (HB-UM43) . I'm able to plug in my USB CD player, wireless mouse button, and what ever other USB you'll use. In short, I am totally happy with my setup and love the portability for traveling.",
"Dead on arrival. This didn't work on arrival - it wouldn't do anything. Amazon said they'd call me back the next day but didn't. When I messaged them, they offered a refund...the absolute least they could do. Disappointed with both the product and the service.",
"A piece of junk!. I bought this as a backup and unfortunately did not start using it until after the return period had expired. A big mistake. This item rarely runs more than 10 minutes before it crashes. I tried three different browsers and none of them made any difference. I think I'm going to put Linux on it and see if that helps. asus used to make a good computer. If you're looking for a good, small laptop, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!",
"This is junk and difficult to get help. Bought this computer and within 3 weeks it went dead. Made a couple of attempts to rectify through the ASUS website but their site doesn't recognize the serial number and won't let you lodge a complaint without it. This is the second ASUS like this that I've wasted money on. HP - Dell are way better options and much better support. This ASUS is junk. don't waste your money. If you could get decent support it might be different.",
"Died after 30 days. Bought this laptop just over 1 month ago. It worked just as expected for the first ~30 days and now it won't turn on. No indication of any problems and I barely used it. It just stopped working. Will be trying to fix it, but I'm not feeling hopeful. Do not recommend this.",
"It worth the price. Empty slot for adding NVME M.2. I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing. Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1. Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD. The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306. I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop. Overall, I would buy it again. [UPDATE 2-3-2021] I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot. I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all it's working fine.",
"false advertising. The max resolution is 1366 x 768 and not the advertised 1920 x 1080 pixels. The processor speed is 1.1 GHz instead of the advertised 2.6 GHz.",
"It was a good fellow for two month.. The laptop was good for two month. I lost my final paper because it just powered out when I unpluged it from the charger. I should save it more frequently, but I did not expect it to happen. I read the other reviews and figured that I was not the only one having the issue. Contacted asus and it was slow and painful. They had no idea and no solution for this issue. They asked to send the unit to them and said the whole process will take about a month. I really hope that they have some smart ways to do the customer service other than wasting the customer's time. Also, the customer service call getting disconnected autometically when it passes 30 minutes. I am not sure why, but I had to call back to them explain my situation every time it got disconnected. I loved asus because my n55s laptop which I purchased in 2012 still runs very well. I also bought a asus chromebook in 2015, which still working except the broken screen (i connected it to one of my tv). However, this time, it was a huge disappointment. Previous review: Great battery life. The screen is reflective and keyboard has no light, but great price and works well. I can code anywhere and anytime now. If you know its capacity and utilize it well, it is the best you can get for the price range.",

What computer two months ago five days after return date will not turn on asking for help from Amazon or seller spent a little over $200 and looking for help or guidance this computer just is not working I will change my review based on helping me or figuring out what the problem is but this is bad business to spend money for a computer does not work please call me at 781",
"Good bang for the price, *BUT* has problems. UPDATED FOR LOWER SCORE: So while I think if it works, it's decent for the price, the issue is that over the past few months, I've had unfortunate issues with the laptop just out of the blue not wanting to boot, nor will it charge, or even display the battery light. Literally dead as a brick. However if you let it sit for ~24-36 hours, *then* plug it in, suddenly it will work just fine for another few weeks, boots up and charges like normal, until it happens again of course. I should have sent it in when it first happened, but I didn't and I'm stupid. It always has (at least so far) come back just fine, suddenly being without a computer for a day or two is frustrating, so I would advise caution when getting this laptop, and if it suddenly turns into a brick on you, just send it back and don't deal with the issue, and get something else. I've seen too many people with this same issue get another one that also doesn't work right. Original review: So, while I think this is a good product for the price, I think it's important to know what you're getting in to, and know what you'll be using it mainly for. To start with the good: -Product is *very* light weight, incredibly easy for transporting, but doesn't feel cheap. Great choice if you need to take it with you constantly, IE student, for work, etc. -Boots quickly -I do think the battery is decent. Watching video for hours on end, or doing a lot of things while music on, etc, will definitely shorten the 'all day' claim, but it's not bad for general use, and you'll get *most* of the day (also that all depends on long your day is, right?). -SD card slot for a little extra storage -Keyboard is good for a small laptop. Normally, in my experience, they are very cramped, this one isn't bad. To think about: -It's not speedy. Watching videos and general web browsing and everyday stuff is about it, I wouldn't even feel very comfortable with 'lite' gaming, so if you think you'll give some of that a shot.... I really wouldn't. -Space is not great. Half of your space is already taken up by the OS, so doesn't leave you with more than ~30 gb. Sd card slot helps, but I would recommend some other kind of external drive or something All in all, if you just need a windows laptop for everyday casual use, and want something very easy to take around with you, I absolutely recommend this one - I use mine all day long for normal browsing and streaming video + music,, but if you think you're looking for something for heavier use, maybe some gaming, or something speedier to run more intense programs, maybe spend a little more on another product.",
"An excellent budget notebook. After 1 month of use: What I like-- Much improved over its prior generation (X205TA): Better surface treatment so less messy fingerprints. Plenty of port for connections. Reliable and large-area touchpad. LED indicators are more visible. Battery life &gt; 8 hrs for my daily tasks. Upgrade to Win10 Home is free and easy. Booting into Puppy LINUX is easy and fully functional w/o searching special hardware drivers Some disappointments: 1. The USB-C is gen 1 that won't support \"Alternative Display Mode\". 2. The LCD is 1366x768. But it was advertised in the comparison table as 1920x1080 . See link and scroll to the comparison table. \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N6S4SY1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" 3. Top surface coating isn't scratch resistance. Remember not to put it against something too hard. 4. HDMI output support 4k but it is very slow and unusable. It is fine however for 1920x1080 output.",
"Update: A great portable notebook for grade school and elementary school kids.. Update: Bought this in August and it is now only April, and the battery keeps blinking which prevents the computer for turning on you have to do a hard reset to get it to come back. It does not lose any data but it is very confusing for a 10-year-old I bought this little nap book for my 10-year-old son so he can do his schoolwork, his school already get some Microsoft word for free, but it does come with a subscription. He plays a game that we installed called the adventure Academy that is educational. And he seems to play Roblox just fine. We haven\u2019t used it much without it being plugged in at his computer desk, but it is very light and portable, we actually use something very similar in the school systemA great portable notebook for grade school and elementary school kids. I recommend using an online drive like Microsoft one drive, Google Drive to store your files and to free up space. This is no bigger than a sheet of printer paper, which makes it very convenient to fit in the backpacks, I do recommend using a laptop sleeve when storing it in a backpack",
"Great light-weight notebook!. This notebook is great! We got one for each of our kids for their schoolwork, and my wife liked it so much I got one for her as well. These work so much better than the HP stream!! The build quality is nice, and the battery lasts all day! I took one on a business trip where we were doing a lot of document collaboration, typing all day long. It lasted all day! I highly recommend getting a micro sd card to store all your files on, leaving the small (64gb) hard drive for programs only. Some people have complained about the laptop suddenly not turning on. We have experienced that from time to time, and don't know what causes it. The solution is to hold the power button down for about 40 seconds, release it, and then press it again normally. It usually fixes the problem. These computers are not for gaming, heavy photo editing, or video editing (though my kids do make stop-motion lego videos with them). They are meant for internet browsing, creating and editing documents, watching videos, and writing emails. The webcam is slightly better than awful, but it gets the job done for zoom, skype, etc. The audio is good, and the realtek software allows you to select whether you have connected headphones, a headset, or microphone. This allows you to plug in a microphone for a zoom call, but use the computer speakers for listening. We are very pleased with this computer for this price! Nathan",
"Stopped working after 9 1/2 months. Worked great until it died. Screen went black. Would not boot up again. It was under warranty. Sent it to ASUS for repair. They do NOT have an address for repairs so I sent it to corp w/all the data. Now they say they don't know where the item is . They apparently have not read my 3-4 emails because their responses to mine are completely non sequitur. I wonder if anyone is there or if the customer service response is simply computer generated. It is as bad as their help page. \"A circular maze of blah blah.\" Their return (RMA# link) didn't work and they have no tech repair address to return the laptop for repairs. In addition you are hard pressed to find a \"Real customer service e mail\". I asked them to find it,fix it or refund my money. A real waste of time. 6/2020 Up Date: They found the laptop and according to customer service it is being repaired. They will let me know when it is repaired. UPDATE: 7/2/2020 They repaired the laptop. It works well. I am very pleased w/the product over all. Hope it lasts.",
"Excellent Linux daily driver. I needed to replace my old Gateway netbook so I gave this one a try, and liked it so much I immediately bought a second for my partner. The first thing I did for both was to rip out Windows and put a proper OS in place, in this case Arch Linux, which installed without a single hiccup. Admittedly this is not a powerful computer. However, for daily tasks (web, email, IM, music/video, office, web editing, coding) it's pretty ideal. It's very light, has excellent battery life and a responsible keyboard, and with a lightweight DE (i3 or xfce) it doesn't give me any trouble even with several dozen browser tabs open. In short, a great little computer for my needs at a great price.",
"DO NOT BUY THROUGH AMAZON WAREHOUSE. DO NOT BUY THIS USED FROM THE AMAZON WAREHOUSE. I wish I had read the earlier review about this. Though there is no indication in the description, the Amazon Warehouse version of this product does not come pre-loaded with Windows (meaning no Windows S Mode or Windows Home). The computer will promote you to activate Windows but there is no Product Key provided by Amazon. Check the other one star review on here that details the issue. I've gone through 2 returns now, and I cannot get a usable laptop. Amazon will have you talk to Microsoft, who will have you talk to Asus, and they will give you a product key but it won't work unless you have the recovery media for your laptop (not included in warehouse laptops apparently). Basically, if you buy the Amazon Warehouse version, you will most likely need to by a copy of Windows. DO NOT BUY THROUGH AMAZON WAREHOUSE.",
"Super compact, awesome battery life, handles Win 10 and basic productivity apps no problem.. If you loved the portability and battery life with your chromebook but missed some features of Windows, this is perfect. I took mine out of S mode (prompted to do so when downloading 3rd party software). It runs spreadsheets, word processors, and anti-virus software with no issues. Video streaming, web surfing, email, Roblox with kids, no problem. Goes all day without a charge. Smaller than an 8x11 sheet of paper. Fires up as fast as a chromebook. Keyboard works great. In love with this machine!",
"Awesomeness. It is perfect for me to go back to school with thank you very much.",
"It was everything I wanted and then some!. I\u2019m a final year medical student and I was really struggling to use my 7 year old laptop. I was hoping it would be good enough to just study for my last board exam before graduating but it couldn\u2019t even open web pages reliably! And literally took 5 mins to just turn on. I found this laptop on amazon and watched a ton of review videos. It was super cheap so I was wary, I was concerned it would be unreliable. But ultimately I went for it, and boy was that a great call. It comes with a free year of office so in my head I knock $80 off the price because I was paying for office anyways. So that knocks the price down to $190 for this laptop. At $190 this is an incredible value proposition! It has a monster battery life and it\u2019s great for. - Webpages - Osmosis - Boards and Beyond - OnlineMeded - Uworld - NBME practice exams - Anki, without the media files though - MyEras and everything else regarding license applications and residency. You can open a ton of tabs at once with no issues at all. - I definitely suggest buying a small SD card and using that to store everything off the actual emc thing. Some minor issues It\u2019s $190 so it\u2019s not gonna be a MacBook Pro or anything. But the issues are minor if you\u2019re just looking for something to study with and take care of basic computer work. - trackpad gets a bit stuck occasionally but nothing that causes a major issue. - keyboard isn\u2019t backlit but that\u2019s not something you can expect at this price point. - it\u2019s most useful in S mode I think, I haven\u2019t tried to take it out of S mode because I\u2019m not sure how well it would handle it. And it works well now so I don\u2019t feel the need to try. When I was looking for reviews I was worried about the compatibility with the programs I would need to use. If you\u2019re in med school and you just need something cheap and reliable to study. I give this a 100% endorsement for the price point. I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase, so much that I\u2019m writing my first review! I think this would work well for most other uses as well but as I\u2019ve never used it in any other capacity I can\u2019t really speak to that. I\u2019m definitely a big fan of Asus now!",
"Not a touch screen, max resolution is 1366x768.. I'll start with the happy surprises. First, you can easily remove the \"S mode\" aspect and upgrade to full Windows 10 64 bit in seconds. Second, the processor ( cpu ) IS actually 2.6ghz despite some reviews saying otherwise. It is just designed to only boost up to 2.6ghz when that much processing power is needed. The bad news is despite being tagged as a touch screen, it is not. Its maximum resolution is also not 1920x1080 as suggested multiple times. I found this product through the \"Item comparison\" list where it says 1920x1080 and that was a big part of the reason I bought it. As a result of the multiple examples of misleading advertising, I will be giving this one star less than I feel it would deserve otherwise.",
"Hardware and Software Issues. Really wanted to like this. I have 2 other Asus products that are true to the Asus tagline \"Incredible\". This machine is still \"in search of incredible\". Volume buttons were DOA. Plastic case looks well constructed but it transfers fingerprints so efficiently that I don't think I have to wash my hands anymore to avoid Covid-19. Windows S should be called SOS or perhaps POS. Very limited app store for this OS. Won't run 32 bit apps which I absolutely need. Yes you can replace S with W10 and run 32 bit but the system runs like a drunk and blind pig under the resource hog that is W10. Office is not free and neither is cloud. Keyboard is not backlit. I have an Asus ALUMINUM case Chromebook, backlit keyboard, FREE office, FREE cloud and the OS is lighting fast and feather light. This machine cost $50 more and has none of those. It's basically an overpriced Chromebook without any of the benefits.",
"Bought 3 of these, all of them work great. First, due to Covid the prices on these got escalated. These are typically $190ish and that's the price I bought them all at. At this price these are really good. This is perfect for doing school work and there is a micro SD slot that you can buy 128gig micro SD's for 16$ here on amazon and upgrade the storage. I did that on all of them and its more then enough storage for my kids school work. There has not been a single issue on any of them and they all run quick. Please note this is a protected windows 10 operating system which means you can not run aftermarket (non Microsoft) software to protect the systems by default from corrupt applications. Again, this is perfect for kids. At the 190$ price point these are an excellent buy and I definitely recommend.",
"Not bad so far. I've been using this computer for a few days now and have enjoyed it. I'm not tech-savvy by any means, so this will be a review from a regular old user. The Good: -Inexpensive -Easy setup -Quiet keyboard -Nice, clear picture -Plays streamed movies well (Hulu, Prime, and YouTube tested) -The battery lasted for HOURS (so far). I initially charged it for the recommended 3 hours before using it. -Hooks up fine to a hotspot and wifi -Works well with collegiate school work (I am 100% online and mostly use Microsoft 365/Office/Word/PowerPoint etc.) -Lightweight &amp; compact The Bad: -The screen is GLOSSY -The touchpad lags when I'm scrolling for longer periods -Low internal storage space (I save on various clouds but you will definitely need external storage space for apps/updates) Overall, it is very basic and perfect for those light users like myself. It's inexpensive, user-friendly, and decent for the price. It is lightweight and compact. I will try to do a review at a later date, but for now, everything is in order, and I am enjoying my new laptop :)",
"Started out fine, ended up stuck to a wall. I bought the laptop specifically so I wouldn't have to be stuck at my desk, on my desktop, when I wanted to work on things. Started out just fine, too. I was able to carry it anywhere I needed, because the design leaves it VERY lightweight, and the battery life was pretty decent. Or, rather, the battery life used to be decent. About a month or so in, the battery stopped charging. At least, the laptop SAYS it doesn't charge. I've done a few test runs to see if it's charging and just...not registering that it is, but the conclusion is still up in the air. As it is, I'm stuck connected to a power outlet, since the battery life is stuck at about 12 or 20%. It says it won't charge, the battery isn't a removable one so I can't just replace it to see if that's the issue, and I've followed about 10 different guides online to see if it's some program issue and none of them have fixed it. So now I'm stuck with a less-powerful-than-a-desktop laptop that has to always be plugged in/can't be used as a laptop should be. I liked the laptop, which was the sad thing. Now it just sits and collects dust since my desktop is superior in every way anyway.",
"I use this laptop for everything. I initially got this laptop to do minor work (Word, canvas, picmonkey, advertising) but I pushed it a bit further and play League of Legends. It runs! There are moments when the game loads up and the window seems like it closed out, but that's only for 5 seconds and you're in the game. I highly recommend if you're looking for a laptop for light gaming and work",
"This thing is pretty bad. It doesn't have touch screen for 1. It is small so portability is good, however it still runs in an aspect ratio that makes visuals hard to see, but that's not my main complaint. I bought this refurb a few days prior to a trip because I needed it for my trip. I got it late and couldn't use on the trip. So I got home and attempted to test it just to find out that it can't run anything. The CPU is so slow it runs at 100% with just windows applications running. Let ne elaborate. I set this computer up, did all the updates\\installs and it runs so slow with nothing installed or running just the windows processes, that I can't even load up edge to Install Chrome, This computer belongs in 1995 running Windows 94 because it's THAT slow. Unfortunately by the time my trip was over I had missed the return policy deadline so I kind of got screwed. Moral of the story unless you want a drink coaster or a paperweight (that's what I use it as now) DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!",
"Good small, light laptop... flaky touchpad. By far the nicest feature of this laptop is it's portability. It's *extremely* light compared to other similarly-sized laptops I've used. The keyboard is decent and has good key size/spacing so you can do normal typing without feeling like you need to compensate for the size of the keyboard. Performance is adequate for most everyday tasks; surfing the web and reading/answering emails. The only negatives are the screen and touchpad. The screen is just \"ok.\" It doesn't seem to have great contrast even when adjusted using the Intel Graphics app for this hardware. The display is also just not quite as crisp as other laptops I've used. By far the biggest negative is the touchpad. It seems to randomly stop tracking when you move the mouse around the screen or try to scroll using two fingers. Sometimes it works fine, but intermittently (enough to be annoying at every usage), it stops responding, then starts up again a second later. I've read many discussion boards and it seems this is a known issue with ASUS touchpads. All Windows updates are being automatically installed and it says it's up to date. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling drivers (including the ASUS Smart Gestures app), changing the Windows settings for the touchpad by setting it to maximum sensitivity but the problem persists. It's not quite bad enough to suffer the restocking fee and return it, but it really does need to be corrected by ASUS. I have no idea if it's a hardware or software issue. I would say overall it's a decent laptop, but if I were doing it over again, I'd probably look elsewhere primarily due to the annoyance of the touchpad.",
"Glossy cover. Just be careful if you care how it looks, the cover scars easily, I carried this in a nylon stuff sack in a backpack. The laptop was next to my back and it's top, the glossy top, was next to a camera in a camera bag with 1/2\" of foam between its inner and outer nylon material. The camera is expensive so the whole kit was treated gently but the cover of this laptop got abraded by contact with the camera through 3 layers of nylon and 1/2\" of foam. The only pressure was the weight of the camera and the mutual weight of the items pressing against each other in a lightweight strings-for-straps type backpack. The gloss of the cover was abraded so it has random marks on it, disappointing when I was treating it about as well as practicable. I guess I could leave it at home in its box.",
"dead after 7 mos. It will no longer turn on. There is no information on how to get help, if you click the support key you just get a list of features. This should be under warranty but you can't reach anyone to utilize the warranty. This laptop was purchased 7 mos ago and it is just dead. Disappointed in the quality and customer support.",
"Writing papers and watching academic presentations? This laptop is for the academic yo.. I needed a typewriter with internet access for school and got just that for less than $200. Videos take a few extra seconds to a minute to upload and all my files are saved to the cloud, backed up on a 32 GB microSD. I haven't owned a computer in years, what can't you do on a smartphone or tablet? This fit the niche for a compact device with a full keyboard and screen large enough to split between Word and researching online journals. Only dig, wishing it had a backlit keyboard as I do most of my work at night and the smaller keyboard messes with my muscle memory.",
"Great except keyboard doesn't backlight and numberpad is disappointing. EDIT: Ok, so i rescind what i said about the number pad...i guess i was hitting the keys to hard and not turning it on/off properly...so like i just figured out that you just barely have to touch the pad and to turn on/off you have to leave your fingertip on the on/off button for just half a second longer than you think you would need to...i think i will actually love this number pad eventually (need to get a mouse first- turning it on/off a bit annoying but you can still use the pad as mouse with it on but it gets hard to know what youre doing if youre entering a password for example and cant see what youre typing) Battery is great, overall really perfect for my needs. Screen could be a little better but makes sense its a trade off for the long battery life. What I don't like is that i thought the number pad would be amazing but it pretty much just doesn't work at all. Also, I thought the keyboard would be backlit and it is not!",
"If yours goes dark, do a hard boot to fix.. I received and set up the computer with no problems. After using it for a week or two, I closed it down and used my other computer, a desktop, for two or three weeks. Just now I powered up this ASUS laptop and after signing in, it went into sleep mode. I got it to wake up again and rebooted it. After going into sleep mode a second time, I once again pressed the on button and it remained dark. After pressing it again, the screen came up a deep blue with the white mouse arrow visible, but nothing else appeared. A Google search turned up the fix: Unplug it from the power source. Press and hold down the on button for several seconds, or until the machine totally shuts down and the light goes off. Then press and hold down the on button until the machine boots up again. That's what fixed my problem.",
"Well it lasted 4 days, then died.. I was impressed at first, needed to by a Windows based laptop to run a certain program I need for my business. Tried to turn it on today and nothing, power adapter cable plugged in, dead. So Amazon is great and they are sending me another one asap. I hope this is just one of those things that this ASUS was defective. I have built many computers in the past using ASUS motherboards and they were bullet proof. This lasted 4 days!!!",
"Not sure about buying it. Had to send it back battery dose not charge",
"S Mode. I had no idea what to expect with this computer. I was just excited to have a windows computer instead of a Chromebook but I was wrong. It's very frustrating. I kept trying to get out of S mode and nothing was working it kept telling me something went wrong. That right there was the biggest stressor. And I also didn't care for the mouse it was very touchy. I don't like it. That S mode thing is really dumb. I don't recommend this laptop to anyone.",
"So far so good. I have only used this product for a little over a month. I don't require a lot from my small computer. I have a desktop on which I conduct most business. I don't game, I am not on any social media, and I rarely stream programming. Price and size were major considerations in my decision to purchase this laptop. Reviews were ok and most complaints addressed things I don't do on my laptop (gaming, data storage, and etc.) There isn't a huge choice among laptops with displays under 13\". This one is under 12\" and very light. It does NOT have touchscreen. It's streaming capability meets my needs. There has been no problem watching a program without audio interruptions and/or video freezing up. WINDOWS NOTE: I'm not tech savvy but I was able to update from the Windows 10 OS easily. (If you don't do this, you can't download any non-Google apps.) I had a very hard time registering the product. I kept getting to the point of submitting and I could get no further. I emailed customer support for advice and they got back to me within hours with a link through which I was able to register. I would recommend this computer if your expectations are similar to mine. It is pretty basic and it has been easy to use. I haven't tried features like the SD card or the HDMI so I can't comment on them. GENERAL NOTE: If you don't leave your laptop on when you're not using it, I recommend going to \"settings\" and checking for updates on a regular basis. There were a bunch of updates needed when I first brought it up and that was an on-going need for several days.",
"Terrible product!!!!. Very unhappy with this product. Bought when they had the black Friday deals, went through the set up of everything. Had the computer sitting for a few days, go to turn it on and NOTHING!! It won't charge, it won't turn on, it won't do anything. I didn't even get a chance to use it yet. I wanted to return for a replacement, but I'm scared of this happening again and then being out the refund time. Very upset with this product and I honestly would not recommend purchasing.",
"Just trash !. Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash \ud83d\uddd1!!!!!!! You can\u2019t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn\u2019t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid \u201cwindows 10s\u201d upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !",
"Awesome lightweight everyday task laptop!. For surfing the web, checking emails, streaming music services, this is perfect! Nice construction, lightweight and compact, and beautiful design. I especially LOVE the inclusion of the USB-C port, which I will use to connect to a portable external monitor. For every day tasks around the house, this fits my purposes perfectly. Update 1/15/21 - a few things - the product description mentions \"backlit keyboard\" but I can confirm this model definitely does not have it. Also, the USB-C port delivers power to another device and also transmits data, but does not output video to an external monitor. And I cannot get the NumberPad function to work, but maybe it's because I am keeping the device in \"Windows 10 S mode\" and cannot update the driver. Anyway, for $199, I can't complain much about these omissions/problems. Update 1/18/21 - thanks to one of the other reviewers, I figured out how to get the NumberPad to work properly - you need to very lightly touch each of the numbers and they will appear. I guess I was pressing down too hard. So with that problem sorted out, I'm very happy with this laptop so far!!",
"Not super fast but good enough - Charger/Connection Error after 1 year. Cheap computer that does enough for my 10 year old. This was a last minute christmas gift for my son. Wanted something cheap enough that if it broke (dropped,etc) we weren't out hundreds of dollars but something he could play Minecraft, Roblox, etc on and do occasional school work on. This computer has gotten a great deal more use this year (thanks a lot 2020) and has been doing full time remote learning (zoom, Google docs, etc) since September. It has not crashed or needed a hard restart once during this time. Purchased for $205.00 plus tax December 2019. [Update --&gt; January 4, 2021] Computer stopped charging, problem with the charger connecting to the computer. Contacted ASUS, explained the problem. They ran me through the same problem solving steps I had already run through but I was happy they were being thorough. At the end, they told me it would need to be sent in for servicing, this was fine by me. However, they were going to charge me $85 diagnostic fee plus what ever the cost was to repair the computer. The warranty expired on 12/25/2020 which was 10 days prior to my contacting ASUS. They would not honor the fact that the warranty was only 10 days expired and refused to help me out. So I now have a brick worth nothing. I for sure won't be buying ASUS anymore.",
"Waste of Money. Too small. Limited storage. Very slow. Requires external disc drive. Very basic. Would not recommend even for grade school students. Do to very small screen size, font is virtually unreadable in some apps. Spend more or look for sales at Amazon or Best buy. Definitely not for college or business user. I bought it in a pinch. I use my I-Pad Pro 2018 with Ipados 13 as my main laptop. I use the Asus when material I receive is on a cd-r. That's it. Should have returned it but needed it for a trial. Trying now to wipe it completely to give to my niece, for very basic stuff. One pro: highly portable and lightweight.",
"Poor Battery life and unreliable WiFi connection.. The battery life made this a non-starter. However the most frustrating issue was intermittent dropping of WiFi. Spent the better part of two days trying various support suggested fixes, including but not limited to: Re-Doing ASUS supplied power profile to eliminate shutting down WiFi adapter, Updating timeout Registry entry with REGEDIT, Dowloading and installing ASUS BIOS and several drivers, Updating Windows 10 with fixes, ETC. NOTHING HELPED. THis was to replace a 6 year old HP STREAM with a (after 6 years!) broken hinge. Returned this self contained PC TECHNICAL SCHOOL device and BOUGHT ANOTHER Stream!",
"Completely died after 8 months of use. No abuse...no reason...kaput! ASUS fixed BUT DIED AGAIN!!!. I bought this for my daughter to use at college. She used it for one semester with no issues apparent. One afternoon it just refused to start up ....fully charged...no response. SO I sent it back under the warranty and after about 3 hours on the phone trying to assure the person that I was legitimate. They did fix it and return it within 10 days...YAY...I thought. 2 1/2 months later it DIED AGAIN. No warning just had turned on that morning no problem but that afternoon it would not turn on and I waited...no go for two days now. RETURNING AGAIN ....SIGH...if company wants business they may want to back up their products with performance.",
"Perfect Linux Daily Driver. This is the perfect super-portable Linux machine. I can run Dwarf Fortress and Stardew Valley without an issue (at the same time, even). I had some trouble with Wi-Fi drivers installing properly using Manjaro/Arch and gave up before going too far down the rabbit hole. Mint works perfectly using the Xfce edition, and I\u2019ve got i3 windows manager installed next to that and it\u2019s flawless. Drivers seem to work out of the box (with the correct distro at least). Battery life is so good - I\u2019ve never gotten past 50% before my nightly charge. As a point of pride I didn\u2019t even let it boot to Windows before ripping it out and putting Linux on, so I can\u2019t speak to that, but you definitely get a great bang for your buck running dainty Linux vs resource gobbling Windows. Hard drive is big enough that I didn\u2019t feel the need to get a microsd, though there is a port for one. I still have 33 GiB free after the OS and all of my tools. No fans to make noise, no moving parts really which is nice if you like it quiet and clean. Despite this the bottom gets only pleasantly warm but nowhere near hot or uncomfortable with a heavy load. It\u2019s very light at about two pounds, and the size is big enough to not feel cramped while still fitting in practically any bag. There\u2019s plenty of ports despite the small size, and the the inclusion of HDMI is surprising but welcome. The keyboard feels good. The touchpad is fine (though with i3 or similar windows manager I don\u2019t need to use it much). I even got the webcam and mic to work with out of the box drivers. The screen is very glossy, but the range of brightness is good and so far I haven\u2019t been too bothered by reflections. Everything is plastic to keep it lightweight. It feels well built, not flimsy. I wouldn\u2019t trust it to hold up to rough handling, but I\u2019m not worried about it jostling about in my book bag. Overall I couldn\u2019t be happier with the little guy. It\u2019s exactly what I was looking for, and seems like it\u2019ll serve me for years to come.",
"WINDOWS S is stupid switch to 10 and its good. Bought for my child to use for distance learning kindergarden. I really haven't messed around with it to see how it preforms. So far it's working good for connecting to zoom by wifi, it does not lose the connect or buffer Lagg and the cam I guess is fine his teacher can see him. I don't like the WINDOWS S it sucks and so I got rid of it and switched to the reg windows 10. Windows S is a joke it's trying to be like apple \"safe\" and not let the user dl or install any apps that are not from the Microsoft store and approved by Microsoft, and ur stuck with there browser and them keeping u inside there stupid lil safe bubble monitoring to ensure the computer and user are Microsoft safe. LAME. EVEN AS ADMIN I CUD NOT CHANGE SYS SETTINGS. With that said computer works great if u get rid of S and switch to windows 10 and it's free to do so dont get scared when it says u will lose S forever and can not change back, click swich.",
"This is perfectly a piece of junk. Had unit for just 6 months. Stopped working. Will not start. After waiting on chat forever, ASUS agreed that this unit is broken and let me return it for repair/replace. However, I do not know how long I will be without the unit. Bad news!",
"Caution, it comes with Windows Home 10 S. Did not realize this but this laptop came with Windows Home 10 S which doesn't allow you to download and install any un-approved software not in the Microsoft Store; Google Chrome is not approved. So it took me hours of frustration just to install my Google Chrome.",
"Nice, but lightweight capability. Nice physical design, slim, lightweight, very portable. Nice display and overall function; however, the CPU is rather lightweight. My intended use is to pair with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver for specific use amateur radio activity. So far I have not been able to find SDR software that does not run the CPU to capacity, even though I have turned off all the background activities I can locate. I don't want to pay twice the price for a laptop with a stronger CPU for this narrow activity, so I will likely redirect it to another amateur radio activity; or I may return it. I like the computer overall but am disappointed the CPU is not more capable ... particularly since a Raspberry Pi 3 mini-computer is able to do the job. 5/21 Update: The laptop performed inadequately in the activity for which I attempted to re-purpose it. Therefore I returned it and purchased a refurbished Dell laptop with i7 core for just $100 more.",
"Great for what it is. For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get. This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great. If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable \"S mode\", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google \"disable S mode\" and you'll find the steps easy enough. 64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. \ud83d\ude02 ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.",
"I liked its predecessor the X205ta and I really like this little workhorse. The free upgrade to Windows 10 was changed from Pro to Home version, but that may be fine, seems to be. And as another described, is a true \"little work horse\". A lot of my decision to purchase this was based on my previous and still use of it's predecessor, the Asus 11\" X205ta and apparently minus a couple of the cured X205 little annoyances (track pad, two finger scroll). With double the space of the emmc HD, 64Gb, there is enough extra for all the programs I'll need. Increased RAM, faster processor and increased capacities and lower costs of available microSD cards providing plenty of storage, make this very portable laptop able do the same or more work than with any PC I've had in the past. Love it so far.",
"Buyer beware. You get what you pay for.... this laptop really is more of a Microsoft attempt at Chromebook. It doesn't run Google.com or other No Microsoft things. To run TurboTax you have to pay extra for an app from the Microsoft store! Even office software is a subscription service on the cloud (which I knew going in). So this will be going back...my Chromebook is more user friendly. I wanted a laptop for things like office and TurboTax which Chromebook doesn't do... but this laptop cannot do them either.",
"BROKEN AND NOT TOUCH SCREEN? WHAT A RIP OFF...I WANT MY MONEY BACK.. This company and the seller are nothing but a bunch of RIP OFF and I want my money back. How can you sell something that half of the essential keys dont even work? Let me put this in perspective for you all. For example, 10 keys ( f1-f12) DO NOT WORK, but for the sake of my time and sanity I am only going to cover a few. BRIGHTNESS- when I try to turn down the brightness, it takes me back to previous page and repeat what I already read and the turn up brightness button don't even work at all. VOLUME- I can't turn the volume up or down, I every time I press the key to turn the volume down it goes to a full screen and this mambo jumbo data crap pops up. The volume up key dont work at all so does the mute button. If I have to manually turn everything up and down what is the point of having all these useless keys on here? MUTE- the mute key doesn't even work at either. On top of that this computer was supposed to be a touch screen too, not the case. I bought this because I saw some good reviews, and it was touch screen supposedly. Y'all must be the ones writing your own reviews for this product or something because there is no way people didn't catch these issues. BUYERS BEWARE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS: I AM RETURNING IT ASAP AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK ASAP.",
"It\u2019s a nice computer. I think this computer is fine. It arrived looking new and in perfect condition. If it came broken, it\u2019s more than likely due to shipping. In the description, it says it\u2019s a touchscreen, but if you read the Q&amp;A section (you really should), it\u2019s not. And I knew that. It\u2019s a nice, small laptop and the battery life lasts long. I saw a review with a picture and says the top row keys don\u2019t work, but you have to hit FN button at the same time. (duh) Just do your research. Read the reviews, read the Q&amp;As, look at the customer pictures. Don\u2019t rely on the description and product pictures alone.",
"The perfect laptop. I'm a first year college student, and this laptop is fantastic for mobile meetings getting work done, or gaming. I play Minecraft on it a lot, and it never tears. I play multiplayer and there is no stuttering on part of the computer. The battery seems to go in a few hours or so, but that's to be expected. Better than the $500 laptop I returned earlier this year.",
"Fun while it lasted(it lasted!!). Actually it was slow to startup at first and didnt run for a day or two but ever time after that iy has been running smpothly and effortlessly",
"Used Product. No where in the discription, posting does it indicate used product. Laptop arrived re-packaged and with someone elses account already on the device. It appears to be in good condition but the computer is currently conpleting a factory reset so we will see how it works. This is more of an issue with the seller as I did not expect great things with this product. If I purchase an item that does not say referbished, restored, previously used, etc, I expect it to be new. I do not appreciate consumer deception by sellers.",
"Not a Touch Screen and No Battery Life. NOT a Touch Screen as the initial search had indicated. This was one of the main reasons I purchased the item. I purchased this laptop for my son, with schooling now online I had hoped this would be the right size, touch screen abilities and capacity for his needs. He is online for 6 hours a day with breaks for elementary schooling. They play a lot of games as homework and the touch screen was essential. Firstly, the package arrived on time although the shipping was not updated until 2 days before it was to be delivered and caused a lot of anxiety as it arrived the day before classes began. So set up was literally right before class began. Battery: First class was only 90 minutes long, and alread the battery indicator said low battery and slowed down. Attached plug in and allowed full charge. After removing plug it still died just as quickly. Setup: It was an easy step by step setup as any other laptop. The pain came in the updates, it had over 18 listed and it took 90 minutes for the first one to update. So I walked away and set the computer for restart when complete. Restart: It did not restart. It did not turn back on. It indicated the battery was dead and there was no power. I pluged it in to charge for 4 hours and still nothing. Another 4 hours and nothing. Over night and nothing. By this time my son had missed a whole class and I was frantically trying to find anything to connect him. What a waste of stress, money and time. Returning.",
"HUGE screen crack right out of the box... Just returned home from vacation, opened my package, and my entire screen has a HUGE crack/black line going across it... I love these laptops and this is just such an unfortunate incidence. Please, I beg of the company to help me out and replace this for me and send me a new one... this was a waste of money and I can\u2019t afford this type of cash loss right now...",
"A great machine, if you use it for its intended purpose.. I am very happy with this machine. It does exactly what I want it to do, which is be small and light, run Firefox and MS Office, and connect to my printer, all tasks where the Chromebook it replaces fails. It's pretty fast (Power on to desktop in 20 seconds, Desktop to Firefox in six seconds), the sound is excellent for a laptop, using speakers or headphones and it easily provides the advertised 10 hours of battery life. It is perfect for my intended purpose - a machine for use while traveling. This machine is no good for gaming (nowhere near enough storage, RAM or processor speed), video editing (processor and RAM aren't up to it) or any heavy image manipulation. It handles YouTube, Netflix and the like very well. For a basic, on-the-go machine, this one fits the bill perfectly.",
"A low end capable laptop (netbook). This is a descent low end laptop. Of course it is not a powerhouse gaming or video editing platform. Still it fits a light weight easy to handle laptop niche. You can think of this unit as Netbook/NetTop. This was bought to surf the Internet, watch some Youtube, and type up some documents from time-to-time. These tasks are handled well by this Asus model. I would not use this unit as a primary platform and again it isn't for serious gaming or video production. In my case I installed Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS and everything worked with zero manual configuration. The system was paired with an external dongle for a RJ45 connection and added port capacity.",
"Be aware, you can't install some apps without Microsoft approval. Pros...Nice computer for the money. Small and easily portable. Could be faster, but I only wanted it for a Windows 7 replacement. Main Con....My biggest gripe is I have been using several apps for years, without any problems whatsoever, on every computer I have owned running on previous windows OS. With this computer running Windows 10 S, I can not install these same apps without Microsoft approval. I must contact Microsoft to get their permission to Install them, since they aren't on their approved list, as if I am not capable of making my own decisions on programs I want installed. I thought it was MY computer. Guess not. As a senior citizen I don't need a baby sitter to protect me. I really dislike Windows 10 and waited as long as I could before replacing Windows 7. This operating system was described as a Windows 7 look-a-like. That is why I purchased this computer. I would NOT have purchased it knowing I needed Microsoft approval before installing my apps. I game on Steam, but cannot install Steam without seeking their approval. I guess they only want me to purchase games from the Microsoft store. Yes, I am miffed.",
"Do not buy. Do not buy. I Bought it 3 months ago and it's not working anymore. Customer service is nonexistent. Now I have a piece of junk and ASUS doesn't help. They are not answering phones, neither chat their website don't give customer service options.",
"Light and efficient.... This ASUS vivobook is small, light, and efficient, great for computer use on the move, especially when weight is an issue. It isn't the equivalent of a desktop or a larger, more powerful laptop, but it may do until you can get to one. Internet access and word processing is pretty good. This reviewer is not a gamer, but the graphics seem decent. Recommended for limited purpose.",
"You can play World of Warcraft on it. My friends have a Tuesday game day and they use the desktop simulator from steam, I only have Chromebooks and so I bought this one really for the sole purpose of joining them for game night. Then I realized that you could download and play Warcraft. I haven't played it for years but I downloaded it all and I've been extremely impressed considering the specs on this computer. now to be clear, all the settings are on the very lowest, this isn't very important to me but I get fast enough FPS and manageable FPS in the cities on the weekends. Definitely usable for a casual player!",
"Great little computer!. I had bought a laptop with a defective hinge last year. Which unexpectedly broke on me. Anyways, I didn't want to pay a lot for a computer, until I have space for a desktop. This was perfect to hold me over and keep me online. Like other reviewers have already said, don't expect to keep Windows on this. I toyed with the idea when it first arrived, considering that's all I've ever used. But quickly realized that wasn't a good choice. Its just not built to run it effectively, you'll find. Replaced with Linux Mint Xfce and it runs great. Does just about everything my full size could. And boots way faster. The only problem I really have is; the video quality isn't the best, at times. There's also a bit of a learning process with Linux, that I'm still getting used to (starting to like it better, the more I get used to it). If you go in with realistic expectations; It's well worth it, for a computer under $250. Cool to have something so light and portable too. Can be carried with one hand easily without weighing your arm down. And battery life is the best I've ever had with a laptop, honestly.",
"this device sucks!!!!. This device lasted only two months before it died. two months!!! Don't buy one. they overheat and then there's no support!! service center isn't answering phones.... chat isn't answering... and then there's an automated product return for service ... to somewhere overseas!!! Tossed it in the trash and bought something else.. definitely never an Asus !",
"Completely dead after barely using less than a month. Completely disappointed. Laptop was everything I wanted but quit working after less than 25 days. No warning just stopped turning on and will not charge or show any activity. It\u2019s completely dead and I only used it a handful of times to open excel spreadsheets. Returning for a refund as I\u2019ve seen too many other reviews with the same issue and I\u2019m afraid the next one will die after the money back time has expired or after the warranty is out.",
"On 10-21, SUPER Nice little laptop! ALL conflicts resolved! \u263a\u263a\u263a. Rec'd 10-14-20 &amp; got Asus setup early on Thurs, 10-15 and began running into conflicts getting installation system &amp; password updates to sync correctly with phone &amp; tablet. Saturday i took the time to go back through the VivoBook activation/setup process, which also included the update of numerous passwords to allow the Asus to finally sync in harmony with 2 other devices, my phone &amp; tablet. The Asus VivoBook &amp; i have been able to resolve our conflicts of opinion as of Saturday's redo, and i am so far able to log in the other devices without a problem in continuity. So - at this juncture, as i do intend to KEEP this VivoBook - PLEASE go ahead and re-deduct the FIRST payment. With everything working correctly, this IS a fine little computer. At 69 yo, i am somewhat computer literate but was NOT expecting to invest sooo much time upfront to bring this new device into my com-circle, replacing my 17\" HP... I would NOT hesitate to buy again \ud83d\ude01",
"Good value for \"basic functions\" laptop!. Great little compact laptop for the price! I opted to get the 64GB RAM version with Office 365 instead of the one offered with more storage (128GB). Boots up FAST, keyboard is pretty comfortable, enough \"slots\" for any basic uses (x2 USB, mini HDMI, etc, etc.). Overall, it performs well and I am happy I went with this brand. I've had it about two months now and I've been pleased with it's performance.",
"ASUS Customer Care is uncaring!. I live outside of the US and bought 2 laptops in September for disadvantaged children through my US skybox via Amazon to facilitate the children's online schooling. One of the laptops stopped charging last month and would only work while plugged in. Lodged ASUS Query Ref # N2011063423. Called 3 times and asked for solution which points to defective battery being replaced. Was told by various persons at ASUS and ultimately by a supervisor today that due to internal procedure, repair policy, warranty etc. that I have to bring the laptop in to repair. I asked for a solution given my special circumstances and the fact that ASUS is a large international company and is penny-pinching me for a $79 part which they can easily ship to my Skybox address in the US. This was a test of their true corporate image and an understanding of the lifetime value of a customer and they have failed. What a shame!",
"Pretty Good. I ordered this laptop so I would have something to work on while I moved before I get my office set up. First, this thing is tiny. I knew it was small, but it is very small. But if you can look beyond the size, it's a pretty good little machine. It does what I need it to do- runs QBO, allows me to edit my websites, and the internet is fast. It also comes with Office 365 which is a plus. If you need something temporary, or just something cheap, this is a good laptop for you.",
"It's a light laptop. It is VERY light i can work with it in my lap for hours. The product description was completely incorrect, it literally has \"touch screen\".....And there is no touch screen option. Last but not least, the browser. I am really computer savvy and yet it took me quite a while to find the internet browser. That was very annoying. one Last thing, I tried connecting via bluetooth and also tried the C port and the standard USB and it did not allow me to transfer picture files from my phone, and my Bluetooth headphones...somehow they were \"unable to connect\". It is what it is. Overview, its a well made computer for work under the $200 price range. And its a decent laptop if you plan to run another OS system. Even with the side issues, it still is worth the price you pay for it. I was going to rate it a 3 Star laptop, but the the price factor Brings it it up to 4 stars.",
"WOW! What a powerful little piece of perfect!. I went through 3 different lower end laptops (I only need it to run a couple windows specific programs that don't work on MAC) and THIS one is quite the little powerhouse! Very well built, sturdy, and FAST! Start up was almost faster than my MAC! Touchpad is smooth and responsive. I like that it is a \"full\" touch pad too, with no right/left keys below it. You just push down on touchpad to \"click the mouse\". Harddrive doesn't sit and run and run like the other 2 I tried out, in fact you don't hear it running at all. No heat buildup either. It is also very light weight and compact but not \"cheap\" feeling at all. It comes with Office already on it and also Windows 10-S but during the setup process it will even ask you if you want to disengage the S part, very, very easy to do. No you cannot run the world with this and it is not meant for high end use with large programs or graphics intensive functions(gaming) but if you are just looking for a basic, email, browser with a few programs/apps loaded (or use flashdrive storage) this is The One. I never thought I'd hear myself say this as a staunch mac user but this little buddy has made me a PC/Windows fan again. That right there is quite a feat!",
"Great laptop for school and leisure time. We bought two of these in July \u201820 for our high school girls to do homeschool on and they\u2019re perfect! This is January \u201821 and we\u2019ve had no problems. The girls carry them on trips and besides doing school, they play Minecraft on them, watch YouTube on them, and listen to Spotify on them. I\u2019m not sure we set everything up correctly on them bc of Microsoft stuff that popped up, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s easily fixed and it hadn\u2019t affected how the pc operates! Our family has been satisfied with these purchases!",
"Unbeatable for the price. I paid $190.19 for this, which is almost cheaper than the software itself. Boot-up is fast, within 5 seconds. It does everything I need it to and everything I'd ever need it to. Keyboard is solid, size is smaller than a standard textbook, case is seemingly durable. Programs such as Word start up quickly, edge browser is very quick on a high speed connection.",
"Great size for traveling or as a second computer. I'm a writer and can't be without a computer. When my laptop decided to die on me, I transferred my external hard drive to this little guy and it worked perfectly. Just had to download Microsoft Office and away we went. I did buy a regular laptop, but used this small one until I got it. Keeping it as a travel companion and backup computer. The screen is vivid and crisp. The keyboard feels fine, and my external drive just plugged into the usb drive opening and I was good to go. This computer doesn't have a whole lot of memory, so unless you're going to store your large files on an external drive, this isn't that great. For just getting online and doing regular things you're not storing on it, good to go.",
"The keyboard is really, really mushy.. I got this as a typewriter - literally just a simple machine for typing. Unlike a lot of other Windows laptops, I was able to install Linux with ease and it even goes to sleep when I close the lid (no joke that's a huge deal with Linux). It's a really beautiful machine; it's compact and handsome to boot. I really really wanted to love it but the keyboard is awful. In every other respect it's a very nice machine but I bought it specifically for typing and it's the one thing it does very poorly. The keyboard is absolute garbage. You couldn't pay me to write a page of text on it.",
"Great little laptop for the price!. This is a great little laptop for the price! I bought it for my teacher wife who carries it back and forth to school. I added a 128gb card to it and it holds all of her needed files. It is fairly quick, but somethings seem to load stuff slowly. I believe this is because it only has 4gb of RAM. Which is not upgradable. :( The laptop is nice and small and lightweight and easy to carry. You just need good eyesight because the screen is really small. This is definitely NOT a gamer\u2019s laptop. You also need to be able to live with the \u201cnot upgradable\u201d aspect. We\u2019re glad we bought it and just hope that it last a long time like my last ASUS laptop.",
"JUNK. Do not buy. I should have checked the reviews. After three hours of use, I was not allowed to enter the PIN. Tried hard restart and refresh and the whole shooting match. JUNK",
"Ehhhh. I bought this back in January 2020. Everything was running smoothly up until now which is roughly 7 months to the day I bought this thing. The laptop won't charge and the screen stays black for minutes on end (while I'm clocking and moving the mouse). Asus is a company that I will no longer conduct business with and will now but a laptop from a more reputable company like apple. I hate to bash a company like this but it's the truth and just thought that all of you reading this should be aware of this.",
"What happened? Lights out? So soon?. My wife liked this product for it portability. Seemed to do the job for basic use. Used it for video conferencing worked perfectly. No wifi issues. But after 2 months and one day to the next it stopped working. It does not turn on. What happened? What can I do now? I was hoping to get 4 years out this laptop. Too good to be true, Do not buy this product!!!",
"Perfect for School. Started school and have a couple of online classes so I bought this so I can work on homework/reading at work during my lunch and so I can take it on the go if I leave town. It's a very convenient size and I'm really liking the keyboard. I'm used to clacking away on the keyboard for my PC, but these are much softer, but you still get the \"I pressed it\" feel and sound. I don't mind the Windows 10 S at all since I'm not really interested in downloading a bunch of apps. Usually use google chrome, but Microsoft Edge isn't bad at all.",
"Poor screen, OK laptop.. Pros: sound quality is pretty good. Lightweight and small. Speed is OK for office work. Cons: screen quality is poor. Only a very small angle of view is decent for videos or pictures. The contrast and color have much to be desired. I wish I spent a few dollars more for a better screen, but it's not bad for what I need.",
"Perfect Go-Between Laptop. I was looking for a small-yet-sturdy laptop that could be tossed in my bag and easily transported to and from work, the library, a coffee shop, or just within my house. I mostly use it for the Microsoft Office suite and web browsing, occasionally some light video streaming, and that's about it. This little guy runs beautifully with Windows 10 S, everything loads quickly, resolution is gorgeous, and the battery life is outstanding. Honestly, unless you need a full on gaming laptop or something for intense video editing, this is probably all you'll need. Couldn't ask for better, especially for such a great price!",
"I don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s a very basic tiny laptop. I wanted a Lenovo 2 in 1 but the one ordered arrived with 4 keys that didn\u2019t function. I ordered this as a replacement. In a world of touch screen laptops and tablets this isn\u2019t one. The entire shell feels very cheap. It will probably be fine for what I bought it for ( reading and storing old business emails ) but I\u2019ll never love it. I wish Lenovo 2 in 1 wasn\u2019t garbage",
"In 2 month The charger don\u2019t work. after 2 months of use only for virtual classes of child in second grade, the charger stopped charging, does not work, I contacted the seller and never answered. I do not recommend this product and much less for the lack of attention of the manufacturer who is supposed to give me a 3-month warranty. I do not recommend this product no matter how cheap you see it or at least this seller",
"Meh for Windows, 5/5 for Linux!. If anyone's going to use this and hasn't done so (or doesn't plan to do so) look into beginner Linux distros, this thing is the most amazing combination of cheap, portable, and competent once it's free of window's aggressive battery/resource demand. The ports on this are fantastic and should remain useful for the next 5 years at least, with HDMI &amp; 3.5mm AUX for audio and HD video outputs, bluetooth, USB 3.0 slots, a USB-C slot, and a microSD slot to increase storage to something a little more reasonable. I can, and have, used this as a portable media center to \"hijack\" TVs at friend's houses for movies/TV. If you don't plan to try out Linux, it's bearable for a quick news or facebook check, but if you spend a decent amount of time on laptops, this is the ultimate work pony.",
"Don't get this!. It already started with it's very flimsy design of the laptop. Then, after logging in for ten minutes of unnecessary time, it presented account making errors and couldn't download even Google Chrome. When we tried, it said to purchase that feature for $199. My MSI did all this in mere minutes and didn't do any of this so it couldn't be a Microsoft issue. The real reason we sent it back is because it couldn't even run Google or YouTube smoothly. The description is inaccurate. The processor is completely out of date. The description is false. Don't get this. While versatile and good looking, it isn't even worth the posted price at all.",
"7 Hour battery life. Battery life is a plus. The antiglare screen makes it subpar for movies. The ASUS L203MA-DS04 VivoBook is great for movies, which I also have, but battery life became poor. I would purchase again.",
"Piece of junk. I've had this laptop less than 90 days and it started giving me problems after two months. It is requiring a hard restart every time I have to turn this thing on. It's slow as molasses. And I only used it for my school work. I really want my money back but after 30 days you can't. I got the warranty and that's a joke. They told me to do a factory reset. This thing when I do get it to turn on is saying I tried to use my password several times and no one has it was off. So I'm thinking how is a factory reset going to fix this especially if this thing has been hacked in some kind if way. Just totally avoid this laptop.",
"Do not buy. I take back my positive review. It's damaged. Bought in February and has packed up in October",
"excellent computer for basic work. i needed a computer for basic work. MS office, internet, and the like. i did not want a chromebook. the size is small, but the screen resolution is so good that it's not an issue. it's easy to get to normal windows 10. the solid state hard drive is fast, but storage is limited. however, there is plenty of storage for basic work and programs/apps. the battery lasts forever. i'm very happy and would highly recommend this.",
"DON'T RECOMMEND. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. I purchased this laptop on 18th of September 2020. I purchased it for 1 reason, for my 7 year old to do his online schooling, was able to download microsoft teams. So he could get his classes on. I was able to get my son to used that annoying laptop 4xx. The size wasn't the problem cause it was small enough for him. But this won't turn on at all. Like it's upsetting. Within less than a month, it only came on 4xx. And now it won't charge nor turn on. Thankfully my son had a tablet to do his schooling. Waste of my money Why sell a product to people when you guys know it's a waste. I'm pretty sure you guys know the issues with these laptops. But still put it out here so people like me can buy. That's not right. I'm highly upset that fact that I spent all that money for a laptop that just stopped working. Won't charge, nor turn on",
"Just what we needed!. I ordered one of these for my youngest son to do his schoolwork after the schools were all closed, so he wouldn't have to keep using my work laptop. It works really well. We haven't had any issues. I liked it so much I ordered another to replace my older son's 4 year old laptop, and I got one for myself. We still have not had any issues with any of them. Set up was super easy. Both kids are able do their school work and they're able to play some Steam games so they're happy. I was able to download Skyrim and it seems to work just fine. The laptops don't have a ton of memory so I also got some 128 GB mini SD cards to use and that was super easy to do as well. Overall, for this price, this is a really great laptop. I would recommend these to anyone that needs a laptop, maybe not for anything heavy duty, but for personal use it's great!",
"Wonky mouse, no keyboard backlight. This is an overall great laptop for the purpose in which I purchased it--writing documents. My biggest complaint is that the mouse seems to be a bit wonky. I saw that this was mentioned in previous reviews, and yet I still threw my dice. Aside from the VERY iffy mouse (I am still debating if I will honor the warranty for it, as it is that bad) it is great. The only other minor tweek I believe it could really benefit from adding a back light for the keyboard. I'm a writer, and write primarily in the dark/at night, as do many other writers, so a backlight is significantly appreciated.",
"Internet speed is slower than dial up!. Great for taking minutes at work and the keys are easy to use. However, the internet speed is slower than dial up and it's to time consuming to use for internet research. Returning!",
"This computer is a lemon.. The power switch was erratic, often not powering the computer on. Now the Motherboard has to be replaced. This was suppose to be a new ASUS, not a refurbished one. The failure of a two month old computer is something I have never experienced. I am waiting for the repair shop to complete their evaluation of all that is wrong.",
"Great little laptop. This is perfect for a traveling writer. It has enough horsepower and memory to do some lightweight games, like older isometric games, or board games for when the work is done. I plugged in a 256GB MicroSD to get extra storage for kindle books and docs. I used a 500GB SSD external drive with around a 5 GB/s transfer rate, hooked to the USB-C to store and run some Steam games from, and it seems to work fairly well. All in all, I'm extremely happy with the computer. The one and only complaint is no lit keyboard, but that is easily solved with a small USB powered lamp for $9, like this one I ordered. \"USB Reading Lamp, PIKADO Premium 14 LED, 3 Brightness Setting Touch-Switch Laptop Light with Flexible Gooseneck (Black)\" For what this laptop is designed to do, you will love it, with ASUS quality!",
"Good computer but office365 is a problem. I got this as a small laptop I can take and do work away from home. It would be great with the free year of office365--its not really office365---you HAVE TO BE ONLINE to use it. That really ruins the portability of a laptop--can't use it on planes or coffee shops or trains unless you pay for the wifi. You can't even type in the excel or edit an existing word doc unless you are connected to the internet. They should update the description to microsoft lite or whatever it is.",
"Great -- WHEN it works. It DIED after 35 days..... Great when it works and was the ideal little laptop to take on business trips. BUT..... The computer DIED after 35 days and was temperamental before then (grey screen, flickering screen, apps closing unexpectedly). NOT impressed with ASUS. Thankfully I have a MAC as 'backup'. Going through the warranty process now.....",
"Pay attention to the bad reviews.. I seen the bad reviews but there were more good than bad so I purchased. This was in JUNE. Loved it! Now we're in AUGUST and it stopped working. Not even a good 3 months! A freaking refurbished laptop would've lasted longer than that. Don't waste your money.",
"if it doesn't turn on or wake up, try this.. If yours ever stopped working or doesn't turn on though the charging light is still on, unplug everything including power charger, USB, etc. Then press power button for 10 sec. Then put the power charger on and turn it on. It worked for me when I thought I bought a bad pc. Thanks to Amazon tech support! I didn't know it is a common issue on pc.",
"Lightweight and small. This laptop was smaller than I expected. But that's my own fault for not being great at measurements. The laptop is super lightweight. It doesn't weight much. I was planning on returning it because it wasn't what I had originally wanted but I've fallen in love with how easy it is to carry and move around since it's so compact. This might be the laptop I take with me on trips when I don't want to lug around my huge laptop.",
"Wonderful Laptop With A Small Price Tag. Replaced an older Chromebook with this laptop. I am very happy with everything about this computer so far. It loads up fast - has a nice feeling keyboard - all the features of Windows 10 - it is quite lightweight. It holds a battery charge all day. So, for right now I am so thrilled to have a laptop again. I use Chrome as my browser and that was easy to load and works quite well.",
"Mouse pad is faulty. Great laptop to use once a week. Bad laptop for daily use.. Computer was great at first. Mouse pad started to just not work after a month and a half. Ive tried adjusting all touchpad options and sensitivity. Now the arrow just randomly stops and if you lightly smack the touch pad (which eventually gets tiring) the mouse starts working great again. Wont buy this computer again.",
"10 hour battery life with linux. I wanted a slightly smaller sized and much better battery life laptop to code on in my free time. I was looking at macbook airs but at 4x the cost. The cons: the trackpad is not the best, but not the worst. Definitely workable, but a huge downgrade from a mac. Better than some lenovos. the screen resolution is fine but the screen feels a bit.... odd. i can't put my finger on it. the video card isn't a beast, nor do I need one, but it feels like the refresh rate was obviously low. 2 gigs of ram is enough for what I need, but barely. Getting a windows license was a headache, it didn't come with one and the support was bad. the pros: actual 10 hour battery life. I'm using this for web browsing, coding and small tasks. it handles them perfectly and I get an actual 10 hours of screen on time with this laptop using linux. perfect size and weight to go: Its easy to throw into a backpack or just carry out. usb c and 2 full usb ports. Thats really all there is to it.",
"Great laptop worth the money. This is a great little laptop. Don't expect to be playing games on this though it is designed for remote working and light video watching. Speaking of video watching it looks absolutely fabulous if you're standing right in front of it. If you are off to the side you really can't see it. I upgraded Windows s to Windows home, then I booted to USB and did a clean install of Windows 10 home. This took off all the stuff that I don't like about buying a assembly line product, so after that it was great!",
"Light and Portable. I bought this so I would have a small computer to take with me to write and surf elsewhere. I work in my office all day and didn't want to stay in there after work on the desktop. I didn't need anything fancy. Just a reliable laptop for word processing and occasional surfing. It's perfect for those needs.",
"Ok. The quality is fair for an inexpensive laptop. However the issue that I am having is when the laptop restarts or is put in sleep mode, the screen goes completely black and the power light stays on. In order to get it working again you have to forcefully shut it down",
"No refund for a defective laptop. Despite an obvious defect in the laptop that was delivered to me and discovered immediately, the customer service did not respond properly. They tried to refer to some unrelated issues instead of simply providing a refund. Even though they got the returned laptop no refund is issued so far.",
"No Back Lit Keyboard. This was a MAJOR selling feature for me since I work nights. Description needs updated.",
"Screen gets a \u201cC\u201d; price gets an \u201cA+\u201d - BUY IT!. Buy it for the price and size. The screen leaves a little to be desired. This is a companion PC, there when you need a Windows laptop to get away from your desktop or larger/heavier primary laptop. I considered a Chromebook, but decided it was not what I was looking for since I also have an iPad &amp; iPhone. I bought this to run along-side my gaming/DAW desktop, and it\u2019s fantastic as a \u201c2nd screen\u201d that has little real estate and can be placed just about anywhere. Love the 11\u201d size!",
"meets my needs. I have had no problems with this computer and have been particularly happy with the battery life. I have only owned it for a few weeks but so far it has performed very well. I have used it primarily for web surfing and occasional Netflix viewing with few complaints. Downloading seems a bit slow but that may also be due to my internet provider. I am happy with my purchase.",
"A good simple little laptop. Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift a few months ago. It was a nightmare to watch him use his original laptop (considering I work in tech). The RAM could hardly handle Chrome and Microsoft word for more than five seconds. He\u2019s a simple guy so he was in the market for a simple laptop. He uses it for school and that\u2019s about it. I have heard nothing but good things from him about it. I\u2019ve used it a bit myself and it\u2019s a fine computer if you\u2019re looking to do simple work on it. It still does not operate at the ideal speed I would prefer. However, like I said, it is a simple laptop for those doing simple work.",
"Great for on the go person, must have for a starter kit.. Great size and does not take up much space. Batterie life last about 12 hours depending on what I am doing and how many thing I am doing at once. Use it for accessing the work programs when I am not in the office. Great for a starter computer and to see if it will be worth spending the money to upgrade to a bigger screen, hardware, hard drive, CPU, and other functions. I will be upgreading to a better Laptop that will be with me and this on will stay at my 2nd jobs desk. This way I will always be prepared",
"Someone in my household purchased this and the feedback she gave is.... She really likes it, it came with Microsoft 365 on it &amp; it works perfectly, she uses it to surf the internet, store files and so much more! Her needs were meet after purchasing this and she is getting the things she needed to get done online with this stream book! She Highly recommends this stream book especially if your on a budget. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
"Thank you ASUS. Thank you Asus for creating an affordable computer. This computer is far from perfect. The touch mouse can get spotty after several minutes of use. The camera quality is borderline acceptable for online exam proctoring. However, this laptop is unbeatable with priced performance. It works well enough for timed online education proctoring or casual use of web surfing. My last minute decision to buy this laptop was a happy purchase to this day.",
"Powerfully small laptop!. Amazing deal for this little powerful guy. I do YouTube videos and edit a lot so I needed something with good power, and this is one of the smallest if not the smallest laptop I\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s great. I love it.",
"NOT TOUCH SCREEN. Not a touch screen, cannot use Chrome. I can't review anything else because I'm too disappointed I was misled. EDIT I never initiated a return, yet there is a return status on my account. I don't know if this is Amazon being wonky or if the seller is. I AM considering a return, as the laptop has all these apps for touch screen (including on screen keyboard) but no touch screen functionality.",
"Nice device. Very nice for the price! The power of a PC in a small and lightweight package. After a couple of weeks, I have not found anything I can't do with it. Battery only lasts 3 to 4 hours, which is a minor inconvenience. But the power supply is not heavy to just take with. All in all, it's working well and my tablets are just collecting dust now.",
"Issues after a few months.. I initially liked everything about this computer. Unfortunately, just a few months in and I am having problems. First, the security icon in my task bar indicated a \"quick scan\" was due. When I clicked the button to scan, nothing happened after several minutes of the little blue dots going across the screen indicating the computer was working. This happened after several attempts to scan the computer. Then, I shut it down and restarted it and the security icon showed everything was up to date. Thought my problem was resolved, that is until a few minutes passed and I was back to showing a scan was needed. No help from Windows tech support worked to resolve this issue. The next day after using the computer for a few hours all of a sudden I could not enter my password after the computer went into sleep mode. This computer is now worthless to me! Very disappointed and going to spend the extra money to buy a Mac!",
"Small, light &amp; very portable.. So far it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Small, light, and extremely portable. Even the power cord is small. No crazy power brick on this one! I have other computers to use for heavy lifting stuff so I got this primarily to check emails and for writing on the go. Speed seems great for what I want to use it for, and setup was a breeze. My plan is to not clutter it up with other apps and use it strictly for writing and email. So far I\u2019m psyched about the purchase. Will update review in a few weeks.",
"Nice laptop for online schoolwork. The product arrived on time and as described. This was a replacement laptop for my pre-teen and it works pretty well for her to do her schoolwork online. She also uses it to play Roblox and has no lagging issues. I intend to get a 128 GB mini sim card to boost storage but this little machine is compact and can easily be taken with her anywhere she goes.",
"JUNK!!!! Stopped working in less than 2 weeks. Gave it to my daughter for her 13th birthday September 24th today October 6th it stopped working. Won\u2019t turn on won\u2019t charge.",
"Waste of money. It only worked for 3 days!! Then computer would not respond to clicks. Now I know what brand never to buy again.",
"Battery NO GOOD. Was working great until within the last week the battery quit charging. Nothing. I've checked the charging cable. No issues with it. Checked the battery and nothing. Any options? Ordered the end of March 2020. Return window closed on May 31, 2020. Looks like maybe the first and last time purchasing ASUS. Any options?",
"Bought in September, stopped working in November. Don't waste your money. I got this September 2nd. It was the only computer available less than $800 because of the pandemic and everyone having to work from home. It was clearly cheaper quality, but we had no choice. It isn't used for more than some schoolwork. We use the Microsoft edge for about 1.5 hours a day maximum, Mon-Fri. The battery died on November 6th, it has been charging for the last 5 days and won't turn on. This is a waste of money. It is too late to return on Amazon so I'll have to waste my time trying to figure out the manufacturers warranty just to get another one of these. Like I don't already have enough to do. This is a complete waste of money, I wish I never bought it.",
"Used had no windows license or 365 key.. Bought used in original packaging. I usually have no problem with Amazon reissuing items that were returned. This product arrived with a Windows 10 non-usable license and no window Microsoft 365.",
"Battery Stopped charging after a year of ownership. I bought this laptop last year to use for Arduino projects and for browsing on the road. I used it roughly every week or so for work. I haven't used it much in the last month, and today it stopped charging. It will run while plugged in, but the battery will not charge, and the charge light just blinks showing it cannot connect to the battery.",
"It\u2019s small And enough for me. This was my first laptop and I just love this. My daughter set my laptop up and was able to switch it from Windows S so I can put my anti virus on my laptop. The pages run quickly. I read other reviews some were helpful so for now this is enough for me",
"Fun while it lasted.... Thought I got a good deal.. But unfortunately not.. Used it for one day and now it won't start up.. Very small computer as well.. It ran good.. But I guess it has some bugs.. Thanks again Will be returning today... Sept28 2019",
"What happened to ASUS ? \ud83e\udd14. After 6 months it stopped working as of today because doesn't come on or anything. It sad because this laptop was portable to carry around and performanced efficiently with power points, Mircosoft word, emails and so on. I had to take it to the tech shop to get it charged again. Which works fine now.",
"It's lightweight. That's all I can say for it.. If you love chasing a wandering cursor around and if you don't mind that the cursor strays from where you left it, perhaps you'll like this. I am considering throwing it out. I bought it because my old laptop needed a Windows version update. I so wish I'd just done that, now.",
"overall. small, lightweight, easy to bring around and to travel. the computer overall runs smooth if you don't have too much running on it. compared to other laptops this one will be on the slower side, but if you keep space clean and not too much going on the laptop then this one should last. Not gaming computer. More for a email, surf the net kind of laptop.",
"Dead Again!. Although I typically make a point of writing positive reviews, this time I am not completely able to. This device works for a certain amount of time, &amp; unfortunately, dies after a certain amount of time. It is not even a year old, &amp; this is the second death that has occurred. :( On the upside...when it is working it is great!",
"Black screen. Do not purchase this laptop. I bought it for my daughter and it stopped working after 2 months. I contacted the seller and was told to contact ASUS but when I did, I was told that they would send me an email to fill out a form but after filling out the form, I did not get any confirmation or anything. They made the process so difficult for you to return it. I\u2019m just going to do away with it and get my daughter another laptop(HP)",
"It's What I Prefer to My Full-Sized (and generally lovely) Laptop.... I am so thoroughly pleased with my purchase, I cannot likely begin to adequately cover it to make the point I optimally would about the darling thing. It is powerful, small, lightweight, easy-to-use anywhere and more. If you want a perfect laptop to carry with you when preferred, this is the one - and for the price? It's great even at a much higher one, so that is just ANOTHER gift!",
"Stopped working after six months. Extremely light use. Left it it untouched for about a month and now it won't turn on. The light turns on when the AC adaptor is plugged in but no response from the power button. Quite disappointed. Avoid this product.",
"not touchscreen. Not touchscreen, despite what it says in the ad. Returned it for this reason.",
"Great Battery. I bought this when the pandemic first started here because we were going to start working remotely and it has not disappointed! The screen is great quality, the keyboard isn't too tightly fit and my fat fingers doesn't hit random letters, the webcam is clear for Zoom calls, and the batter basically lasts forever! It was one of the best purchases I've made.",
"No card reader!. I have not yet been able to figure out how to view GoPro videos from the card. I did try a USB attachment device that has a SD card reader but the pc doesn't seem to recognize it. These are small, lightweight and inexpensive laptops that I take on motorcycle trips - it stands up well to vibration and provides basic service.",
"Horrible. Had it for 9 days then i come home from work and it wont even turn on with or without the charger only used it for netflix and youtube , I know for a fact nobody else messed with it because it was locked away where security cameras can see 2nd I only used it 3 days out of those 9 days for no more than 3 -5 hours completley dissatisfied and disappointed",
"Good Computer For Light Tasks. I bought this computer strictly to use as an affordable music server and to watch the occasional movie. For this purpose it works nicely. For more serious applications I would spend another few hundred for a computer with a faster processor and more memory. Also, forget about gaming since its processor is too slow for it.",
"Nice little laptop, great for some couch programming. I needed a small laptop to run linux for some couch programming. It seems perfect for that purpose. I'm dropping one star due to it not supporting the 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution as stated on the details page.",
"Power Supply Went Bad in a Little Over a Week. Wouldn't ship a free one... Whats the point of warranties and stuff if you have to jump through hoops to get anything?",
"Battery doesn\u2019t stay charged for a whole day!. I had to return this computer because the battery couldn\u2019t stay charged for a day. I\u2019ve owned other laptops and the battery stay charged for at least three days before charging it again. OS is fine and it wasn\u2019t a touch screen. Seemed to flimsy to carry. It felt like toy which could break. Don\u2019t recommend this unless it\u2019s only at a desk and stays plugged the whole time. Then what\u2019s the point in it being a laptop.",
"WIFI connection Required to use computer programs. Extremely disappointing. Computers MICROSOFT window software has complete control of laptop. Needs to be connected to WIFI before use. Then After on internet MICROSOFT windows require passwords to use each program on computer. Short of it, If NO WIFI connection cannot use computer. Portable only if WIFI available Still have time to return ? Problem : computer works \" turns off and on.\"",
"Broke after 5 weeks. Battery doesn\u2019t hold a charge after 5 weeks of use. Has to be plugged in to use. I would not recommend!",
"can\u2019t download google chrome :/. it is not a touch screen. you can not download google chrome onto this computer. if you don\u2019t mind using internet explorer or firefox this is the computer for you. other than not being able to download google i love this laptop",
"Great value. I have to move between two locations with multiple floors and this laptop is so light and small that you can carry it around very easily. I use a 128Gb micro SD card for additional memory for programs other than the OS. Very quick. I had to switch from S mode to used other apps.",
"Decent computer. This is a decent computer that serves as a video loop for our Food truck. It is a basic computer, that will meet the needs of a basic user. I will recommend this product.",
"In the blink after just 6 months! AVOID. Loved this at first and then barely used for 5 months. Now after using again for a week, it sometimes refuses to start, regardless of battery or charging. I think the power button is faulty. Do not get this for work! Cannot rely on this at all for anything now. Will be contacting Asus.",
"Slowest laptop I've ever had. I like it because it is very small and great for traveling, however the screen size is also a big minus! I have to scroll a lot to see everything. It is also the slowest computer I have EVER had. Buyer beware! Spend a tiny bit more and get a decent computer. I have had this for only 9 months and I hate it. I am ready to purchase something else.",
"Need a little help. It says it's supposed to come with Office 365 personal. I don't really know how or where the code is to install it. I have had a little bit of a hard time reaching out to anyone.",
"WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!!. Bought laptop on November 9th for my younger sister to do her homework. Only for the laptop to break down today as I write this review. Did not even last for a full year!!!! The laptop just suddenly wouldn't turn on, no lights nothing. Tried rebooting, holding down the power button...etc Just up and died like a goldfish got from a fair. Bit of good advice, spend your hard earned money on a better laptop than this cheap, unreliable hunk of plastic. This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.",
"I guess Windows 10s is bad or the computer. Kept freezing the tracking, opening windows I didn't asked etc - all within one week of buying it.",
"How it works. The laptop I bought worked only A few times ( checked email, etc) After that turned off and ... only problem. Can\u2019t get my money back.",
"This computer is very nice. I love this little computer. Its small but packed with very useful apps and bells and whistles. Its very convienent , it has some weight to it but its not too heavy. My favorite option is voice to text so I dont have to do the typing. As a author its great to just speak my mind and it catches it an keeps up with me. It linked with my cloud from my old computer and my phone and loaded up all my data on its own.",
"I like it. I like this notebook, very lightweight and easy to use. I like the features it comes with, although I did update to windows home. Only issue I have is this thing is constantly updating. Not a bad thing, but I live in a rural area, using antennae based broadband, and it takes forever to update. I have made one trip to the local library, and again at a car dealer while waiting for a repair to be done. The wifi in those places is much faster than I get at home, but it is what it is. Primary use is as a back up or for traveling, so it's OK for use in those situations.",
"Great value for the money. Overall a very competent machine. Usually paid about 700 to 800 bucks for a laptop in the past. This one performs just about the same as those, except that the screen quality is lower overall. Aside from a slightly inferior screen no difference that I can tell between my former 750 dollar laptop and this one for 300 dollars. Very usable machine for 300 bucks. Good value overall.",
"Great until its not. Pros: great price for an ultra compact all day battery life laptop. Keyboard feels great for the price and the screen, although a little dark, is usable and good enough for anything you'll do on the laptop. Cons: After 2 months of being awesome, it wont turn on. I've tried everything short of taking it apart to find the actual issue.",
"Do not buy. This laptop has only ever worked for me once for about 2 hours. It always has a blue screen saying there was an error from the first time I turned it on. Was an absolute waste of money.",
"Portable, and that's it.. It's small and portable. If you're looking for a very portable computer, this works well. Other than that, there's not much to get excited about. The screen isn't all that good, the built in camera is extremely low resolution. The memory is very limited, even for its price.",
"Don't Buy This For Your Kids/Siblings to Do Schoolwork. I tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt when my sister couldn't access Zoom on this but its because Microsoft put MICROSOFT EDGE completely stopping the laptop from letting her access any apps. Seriously what's the point of Edge if it bars the user?? Not to mention it constantly shuts itself off and NEVER charges completely. She'll charge it overnight for school and will still have to charge it while in meetings. On occasion it crashes, too. Please don't buy this. It's not worth it.",
"Doesn't work after only 4 months. Only had this computer for 4 months and no longer works!! I have contacted the seller about warranty and still havent heard back. It won't power on. I have taken very good care of it and bought it for college use.",
"Very good laptop for the money. It is a little slower than I expected, but I'm not a Gamer and I don't watch videos or put any heavy use on it. Honestly, I pay bills, cruise the internet, check my email, do a little research. It is light, charges quickly, and does everything I need it for. When I'm ready to replace it I will invest in a little more speed, but for now, I'm very happy.",
"Love it!. I love my little computer! I\u2019m on my last semesters of school and it\u2019s perfect, it fits all my needs. I can take it with me anywhere because it\u2019s so small. At first I though such a tiny screen would bug me but I don\u2019t want videos or movies a ton so it works great for what I need.",
"This laptop won't turn on after on 4 days!. Wow, we purchased this laptop four days ago and this morning it won't turn on, it was working fine yesterday, nothing happened out of the ordinary, strange. Buyer beware!",
"Great little computers. I purchased two of these for my 7 and 9 year olds after the schools closed for COVID19, so they could remote learn, and do educational games (Khan Acadamy, Prodigy, etc.). They work great for them. One of the computers had an issue with the mic not working, but I got an exchange with no problem.",
"Great laptop. It is not touch screen Screen quality is great. Small and light, very portable.",
"Lame. Product stopped working after 3 months. Woot has been a pain to deal with. Do not recommend.",
"Scammers. It doesn\u2019t have a webcam, you don\u2019t get free windows for a year, the laptop is actually a refurbished item. Don\u2019t waste your money. Because you will",
"Broken after 3 months. Won't turn on. Very disappointed. Avoid.",
"Not a touch screen as advertised. The description states that it is a touchscreen - but it is not. Has S-Mode in which you MUST use Microsoft products only, but if you exit it, you can never go back. The size, weight, screen quality are all great! Keep in mind, this is a SMALL laptop.",
"Horrible product. Worst laptop ever. It will not connect to wifi. I have to call the company on a daily basis. I have sent the laptop to ASUS for repair when they were not able to fix it on the phone. It was gone for months and still does not work. Don't waste your money.",
"no touchscreen. Description says it is touchscreen, but it is NOT! Touchscreen was the only reason why i bought this for my kids, and if i knew it is not touchscreen I would have bought something else. Other than that it seems fine. Seller really should take out the description of touch screen!!!",
"Great little computer. When I retired I no longer needed a full size computer. I bought this little guy for ease of carry on trips, but still accommodate printing and other peripherals. It was also priced right. It does the trick and I would recommend it to anyone who travels and needs an easy to carry computer that provides excellent functionality.",
"Please DON'T BUY!!. Back story: I bought the product only for school on 01SEPT2020 and it was delivered on the 04SEPT2020. I started using it on the 07SEPT2020. The product is light and is portable. The color is very beautiful and the keys feel great. It was deliveried undamaged. Why such a low rating? So today on 16SEPT2020 it doesn't work anymore. It was used only for school. When I was done with school work I shut it down, unplug it and put it away when not in use.",
"Fantastic laptop. I love this amazing laptop it's perfect for my online school and between my daughter and I we share the laptop since she is going through virtual school. Its not heavy fits perfect in a small case and book bag. Very durable love how thin this laptop is its not bulky at all.",
"Overpaid for this laptop!. Bought this laptop on 1/4/21 for $229. Computer works well, no issue at all with it. Yet, a week later, same laptop was listed for $189. Not happy I overpaid, and there is no mechanism other than returning it and buying it again to realize the $40 savings. Should have went to Costco.",
"Keeps crashing. My apps constantly crash even though I have downloaded no additional software at all. The laptop is horribly slow at loading anything. I mean, you pay a couple hundred bucks for a laptop worth a couple hundred bucks so it is what it is. The frustration is not worth the few hundred bucks you\u2019d save when you can just buy a Chromebook or a Surface Pro.",
"Capabible. Nice little home PC. To look stuff up, pay bills, manage accounts, shop, surf, social media, etc. Screen is beautiful! Very nice. I'm impressed and I use PC's all day at work. Mines an Amazon Warehouse purchase, $150 bucks, cant beat it!!",
"ASUS L203MA-DS04 VivoBook L203MA Laptop. Only little lap top I could find for an affordable price with 8 gig. Do not do gaming at all. Love this little lap top best one I have ever had.",
"Spend a little more get something better. This is the second of the same one and first wasn\u2019t correct to spec. Second won\u2019t even get past the loading screen to turn it on",
"Good cheap laptop. This is great for basic functions (word and internet) and for travel, but has a lot of technical blips, forcing me to periodically restart in the middle of activities. I wouldn\u2019t want to use it as my primary laptop but it works well as a cheap secondary.",
"Do not buy. Do not buy this product. Barely over a year old and stopped working. I use it maybe 4-5 times month and stops working as soon as warranty runs up. Called support and it cost me more to send it in for diagnostics than it did to purchase. I will be buying from someone other than Asus.",
"Excellent Laptop. I love this. My previous laptop was 8 years old and was sluggish and just couldn\u2019t do what I needed it to do anymore. I had to get a new laptop for a new school I\u2019m attending, and it\u2019s been fantastic. It does exactly what I need it to do and has all the storage I need.",
"This computer is good for starters to learn. This computer is good for starters and it\u2019s in a heavy duty computer but it will handle email smaller games and websites with these it will print and it will handle most of your standard needs I actually bought a second",
"Good but small started freezing. It\u2019s good but quite small does not have touch screen but it is portable but it stopped working after 11 days do not get scammed by this",
"Great value. I bought this as a \"gaming\" computer for my 12 yr old daughter. I say \"gaming\" because she is only playing games like roblox - lower res games. But for her, this is the perfect fit. Easy to move &amp; carry and faster than her phone. Overall, very pleased for the money.",
"Poor customer support from vendor. I bought this laptop for my 14-year-old, she loved the laptop. For some reason it stopped working after two weeks. I sent it back to the vendor to get fixed and instead they gave me a refund of only 155.69. It was half of what I paid - they deducted a restocking fee $137.48 plus a tax of $18.22. Not only am I out $150.00 now I must go out and buy another laptop. This is the main reason why I am a little hesitant of buying electronics from a third-party vendor. I am upset and will never buy from this vendor again.",
"Perfect for what I needed. Perfect for school. Small and compact. Works fantastic with my college courses. I am able to do everything I need without any issues.",
"Perfect for the price. Great size, perfect for college taking notes, quick start up",
"Complete junk. It says 64gb of storage, but it's actually 28.3gb. It also has \"S-mode\", which means you can only download stuff from the Microsoft store. This is a glorified tablet with a keyboard that's too small to realistically use.",
"Good paper weight. I'd say it's a giant piece of junk but it's really not very big. This laptop cannot do one thing at a time, imagine trying to do two things. If you need a computer that can do things, spend the money on a good one.",
"Very nice little basic laptop. Considering the low price, I was not expecting anything extraordinary. All things considered, I am very pleased with this little laptop. Very user-friendly, nice display, lightweight and easy to carry around. Pleased with this purchase!",
"Works every other week.. This was such a bad idea to think that a $200 laptop would do it. This computer just works whenever it decides it want to works. Everyday is a surprise: is it going to start today or not? Obviously it\u2019s always when you need it the most that this stupid computer will decide to not work. I\u2019m so disappointed and mad.",
"I love that it comes with installed Internet protection virus software.. The computer is new, so it\u2019s hard to give it a review right away. So far I like the size and lightness of the product. Seems fairly simple to find what I need. I needed something small and this seems to work perfect. Mostly using it for surfing the internet and research.",
"Had issues and returned it.. I previously reviewed this item positively which we are asked to do with data of receiving them. However on about the 4th time I turned it on, the keyboard failed to function and rendered it unusable. Will send it back, really had high hopes for this computer.",
"True to its word. I waited this long to review to be sure I am giving a true answer. It works great , light and small enough to talked along display is clear . Good product would recommend",
"Love it!. I have to use complicated software and didn't know how to install JAVA, but with an expert friend installed it and truly love this PC. I use JAVA, Telegram, and ANKI apps and all work great. The price is really reasonable and the weight is great too.",
"Workhorse laptop for kid's pandemic remote school. We bought this laptop as spare and did not use it much until the Covid pandemic hit and we needed an extra computer. My child uses it everyday, all day for school and it is holding up well. The only negative is the screen is not that sharp or bright. But for the price, I can't complain too much. We also put the full Windows 10 version on it.",
"Won\u2019t turn on after very little use! buyer beware!. Don\u2019t buy this tablet it\u2019s junk! I bought this tablet in June have barely used it because I had shoulder surgery and was unable to type. Now that I\u2019m able to use it again and I have here and there (maybe a dozen times) and today it just won\u2019t turn on have tried all troubleshooting....nothing! It\u2019s totally dead pretty upsetting! Looking back on the reviews it\u2019s looks like it\u2019s common problem! Buyer beware! Only gave it a star to be able to post my review.",
"Gets the job done. Light weight and affordable.i would of gave it 5 stars but it's slow to load. I purchased 2 and on kind of lags but it is a great computer to get the basics done. I am grateful so far about 30 days in and it's going well. Esp since it came with the 1 year free 365 program. Since ima writer this is perfect.",
"return boken computer already purchased June 4. this computer has broken and I want full credit for its purchase. It is completely dead. I would like to return it without a re-purchase of same item. I was in hospital and could not return it ny July 4th.",
"Good choice. For my daughter. She loves it. No complaints.",
"This is the absolute Dogs!. I've been a Mac fanboy for ~20yrs and was looking for just a small(top of the bar) kick around(it can break) windows box. Not chrome book. My purpose is mostly for learning and software development and this asus hasn't disappointed. I put in a 256gb and a wireless mouse for when im at the desktop and i use it with my very large monitor(48inch) via hdmi port on the side. another great aspect is that you dont need a brick for power - all very tidy.",
"DO NOT BUY! WILL STOP WORKING AFTER RETURN PERIOD. Do not buy! Bought two for my kids for distance learning. Both stopped turning on. One before the return date luckily. The other after. I know have to go through ASUS to get fixed. The problem is I bought them for school so I needed to replace ASAP. No time to send to manufacturer.",
"It\u2019s ok. I like it. Good for an inexpensive PC. Not great but very light and portable. I like the thinness. The computer works okay but it\u2019s a lot different from a typical laptop PC.",
"Waste of money. I liked the laptop when it worked. If the Lap top was low in battery it would shut off and you could charge it over 8 hours and it still would not turn back on. It would basically work when it wanted to. The powered button was also irritating trying to press because it was really small. Pretty much had to use your pinkie finger to press it",
"Trash. This Laptop said that is has HD webcam, but it lied! That's the only reason I bought this laptop but when I tried to use the camera, the quality was 480p and blurry and not HD. I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone and wont be buying again.",
"Poor Quality. I bought two of these for my kids to use for online school. These are really poor quality. We have had a lot of issues. Poor screen image. Poor camera for connecting to school. The microphone doesn't work consistently. And most recently the headphone jack stopped working. We have only had them for about 6 weeks and have had this much trouble. I expect them to be fully nonfunctional in 6 months or less at this rate. I will not buy this brand again and I would not recommend you buying them.",
"Disappointed. I\u2019m so disappointed. I really wanted this laptop and then it went on prime day for a great price but it\u2019s missing a key hardware component that you need to go on the internet.",
"very light. I needed a notebook type laptop for the weight - or in this case - the lack of! I can use it comfortably on my lap. Took me a bit to get used to keyboard but once I got my arthritic fingers aligned it was a breeze. I don't need a workhorse, but wanted a Windows based notebook. Also easy to switch to regular Windows 10.",
"Great little pc for the price!. Great little laptop for the price! Not as slow as some of the reviews state as long as you know what you're purchasing and what it's intended for. Switch it out of S-Mode and you're good to go with Chrome and other programs. Works great for the programs I wanted to use it for and plays videos great with VLC. Using a micro-sd card for additional storage space works great!",
"Confusing to use.. Goes from one screen to another in order to finish a search. Hard to remember what's what from screen to screen. If it were larger, it would all fit in one page.",
"Subpar screen and touchpad.. Battery life is very good, the screen is difficult to see and the touch pad is very inaccurate. I am giving 3 stars because Amazon let me return it. I invested more money in a Surface Go, beautiful piece or art!",
"Battery Defecitive. A week or two after purchasing and I noticed the battery would only charge to about 90%. I called Asus and they did some troubleshooting and told me it would fix. A few weeks still same thing. Then it started to discharge the battery while actually plugged in. By then I was past the return window with Amazon. Now I have to deal with getting it serviced. So far very disappointed",
"I wish I hadn't bought it.. I really hate this computer, I have had it for a year and wish I hadn't bought it. The mouse is probably my biggest complaint. Since that's what's used the most, it makes the entire experience bad. The mouse clicks things randomly and is just a headache to use.",
"The buying experience could have been better. This laptop came with an inactive copy of Windows. I thought I was going to have to return it. There was no product key provided, so the laptop was useless until I finally got a key code from Asus.",
"Perfect for middle school. Love this little computer. We use it mainly for school work but i have video chatted on it and it works great. I just wish it was touch screen.",
"This is like the perfect gift for anybody. I absolutely love this laptop perfect size light as they say easy to put in any bag and I can get all my work done on it the keypad is wonderful there's so much I could say about this laptop I love and and for the price you can't beat it.",
"It's Laptop. Very light weight and slim. Not too big, not too small for a 6yr old. Very fast operating system. Camera video quality is very good. My first grader is very pleased. Not bad for the price.",
"Very lightweight, use Linux.. I got it used, and it came with windows in S mode, but no valid windows product key, so I installed Linux on it instead. Runs great, better than windows S. The laptop itself is super light and compact. Buyer beware if you actually want to use windows on it.",
"wouldn't turn on after two weeks. At first it was a good computer but after using it for two weeks it wouldn't cut on. i tried charging it for a few hours thinking it died (it didn't even light up to show that it was charging) and even holding the power button down for a few seconds but still nothing worked. Somehow after leaving it alone for a week it finally turned back on. The two stars are mainly for the headache that it caused but at least it turned back on.",
"Do not buy it.. Stopped working. Bought on December 4th. This is now Feb 26th. Really....",
"Online support is poor.. I couldn't contact my email with this product and couldn't do some other things. The company website was no help. I telephoned an agent but he was not much help.",
"Good computer for the price.. I bought this for my son to use for online classes. Its a good value for the money. I like the size because its convenient for travel. He loves it.",
"Good, but no backlight keyboard.. Works good. But the keyboard is not backlit. Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard.",
"Patience required for set up.. Haven't seen anything yet. I don't remember having such a difficult time setting up a tablet or computer!! Not user friendly by any means.",
"Buyer beware. It has stopped working completely. Won't turn on and it is less than 3 months old. So disappointed especially since my kid saved to buy this.",
"Warranty issues. Worked fine for my child for 5 months, then it stopped charging. Warranty requests through Asus have been ignored for more than 2 weeks at this point so I am unable to recommend this product.",
"Cheap quality, small screen.. Cheap quality, not suitable for everyday use. I can imagine this would usable for a youngster or someone who only needs to check email. Screen seemed small compared description - would need a monitor to make this usable for me. Have returned it to Amazon.",
"Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Slow and buggy. Returned",
"Died within 6 months of use. Stopped working 6 month after I purchased it. Will not turn on.",
"Great price and perfect size!. So far I love this laptop! I couldn't say no to the price. It does come in Windows 10S mode, but you can easily disable it - first thing I did. I love how light and small this laptop is. It's not big and clunky like some tend to be. Perfect for if you're on the go! Works great for basic stuff, music, movies, browsing the web, doing work.",
"Big Disappointment , not what it appears to be!. Be warned this is not full size and has very limited ports and capabilities! You get what you pay for! Spend a little more and get a real laptop.",
"Perfect Laptop for High School Student. Good speed, works fine, can do Zoom classes and homework. The touch pad can be a little sensitive at times, but overall works as it should. Battery life is good and lasts the entire day.",
"Super lightweight notebook. Great notebook to travel with. It has all you need for email, Whatsapp and video watching while away from home. And there's room to load any special software programs you may need too. Highly recommended.",
"No Microsoft Office. I just got my laptop and one of the reasons I got it was for the free year of office. Office isn\u2019t on this Computer for free. Anyone know why?",
"No lit keyboard nor touch display. Packaging was 1 star. Overall laptop is a 5 stars. 2 things it doesn't have is1---touchscreen and 2. Backlit keyboard (which I thought it came with). If it had those 2 items it would be 10 stars.",
"It\u2019s good! I can run Ableton and Minecraft.. Honestly, it works amazing! The only problem I have is the storage and the touchpad really. The people who say that it\u2019s too slow are probably just fake reviews to be honest. It loads pretty slow for the first 2 hours but then after the updates are done, its a pretty fast load-up time. So far, I\u2019ve played Minecraft (with resolution down), and it worked great!",
"Do your research!. Screen quality is ok. Not the clearest. Not touch screen.",
"Perfect. Perfect for COVID 19 home schooling.",
"Good product but a few hiccups. I bought this laptop for my daughter on her birthday. Its a good laptop but the audio just stopped working one day. I've tried fixing it but doesnt get fixed.",
"Am returning this item. it said it was compatible with Chrome. It was not, or if it was, I couldn't find the secret door. Never mind getting this unless you're a geek.",
"Not bad for the price!. Its a great casual laptop that is silent and can run what is needed for my college classes. Does not possess a backlit keyboard which was a little misleading and disappointing, but not really a deal breaker. For the price I paid ($190 for the n4020 11.6 model) I am very satisfied.",
"Processor sucks, lies about processor speed. and laptop freezes up all the time. Froze 5 times in a row on conference meeting for work. Embarrassing. -Freezes randomly -laptop is SUPER SMALL for what the picture shows. -Feels cheap and light -bad processor - LIES about processor speed -DOESNT EVEN HAVE A FAN.",
"Feels a little cheap..... ...but so far, so good. Got it as a Christmas gift for my daughters. It works fine and has plenty of speed and memory for their needs. I will update this review if anything changes.",
"Spend your money elsewhere.. Absolute trash. Plastic garbage. Touch screen was unresponsive. Display was horrible. Didn't connect to WiFi.",
"Trash!. HORRIBLE. Worked for me twice. Had it a week. Now its completely dead. Wont turn on. I dont even get the light when it plug it in...",
".. I have this put away for a Christmas gift for my husband, but during set up, I thought it was very easy to use.",
"Terrible used when i ordered new(refurbished)security hole backdoor;. Product quality was terrible, none of the windows 10 came back activated, the physical defective laptop will not even boot up. Very unstable, it was supposed to be knew it seems like it was refurbished and shipped to me, Office 365 would not register either, Product had an unsafe backdoor.",
"Inspect what you purchase. Came without registered windows and no windows key. Do not buy. Pirated software dropshipping. Also smaller than it appears in photos. And they take forever to refund.",
"Nice Lil' Guy. Solid little computer! I'm mostly just using this lil' beaut for writing, and it definitely serves that purpose in spades. All other functions and start ups seem to be pretty zippy, too. The fact that you get a full year of Microsoft Office makes this SUCH a solid value. Yeehaw!",
"ASUS VivoBook L203MA Laptop, 11.6\u201d HD Display. This notebook computer is refurbished but looks and performs like new. There are no drawbacks that I have detected.",
"Super light and portable - great overall laptop. great value for the money.... use it for email, web, word, zoom, etc. no problems",
"This little thing packs a punch. I got this for my college classes, but I'm really surprised at how well it runs some video games I've tried out on it. I didn't expect it to be as smooth and speedy as it is",
"Disappointed. Very tiny... difficult to type on",
"Wonderful tablet. I bought it for my son for school and he\u2019s a little way he does everything with a job and the views go live with his teacher and get me a job at Amazon",
"Good lapto. Good laotop easy to use and functional. God for daily use and lasts. Great for someone that just wans a simple laptop for pictures and videos and badic use. Love it.",
"Satisfied. I am not a tech person. I use this for my basic word documents and research on the internet. It works well for me so far. Should this change, I will edit this review.",
"Does the job. Smaller than what I expected but just as advertised. The screen doesn\u2019t seem as bright or crisp as I\u2019d like but I was a Mac user previously so. Does the job of internet searching, which is all I needed.",
"Stopped Working After One Time Use. After setting up laptop discovered it failed to work. Returned it. Vendor checked laptop and emailed laptop had technical issue and my money would be refunded. Appreciate pending refund. Not happy about purchase; hence 3 stars.",
"Nice little laptop. I bought this for my 10 year old. Great quality and perfect size. If you are looking for a pc to do major photo editing etc... not the laptop for you. If you are looking for a simple laptop that is smaller. This is it!",
"Great little computer.. So far so good. Got this for my son for online school. He loves it. Very small and perfect for him.",
"Nice laptop for email, word, and light web usage. Bought it as a gift for my dad who usually buys used laptops. He seems to love it. At the time it was just $169 so it was a great deal.",
"Great laptop!. This is a great little laptop! I purchased it for my 10 year old son to play roblox, and other games, and to watch YouTube. He loves it and we haven\u2019t had any problems yet and I bought it back in August. He also used it for remote learning until he got his school issued one and it also worked for that.",
"Good for small laptop. This is a smaller size laptop and works well for a school aged child. Product description says it is a touchscreen, but it is actually not.",
"Cute and fantastic computer!. This computer is great. It\u2019s screen quality is fantastic! It\u2019s an adorable computer and compact so I can take it anywhere. It\u2019sa quick computer which is what I was looking for. I am extremely happy and would recommend it!",
"Not very good quality. We\u2019ve had this for four weeks and it just quit working. Screen went black, can\u2019t turn it off or on, nothing. We have antivirus software on it and it hasn\u2019t suffered any damage. Very disappointed.",
"not for virtu school work. I bought this for my granson to use while doing school virtual. His mother said that it gliched a lot. other that that I guess it was okay.",
"Great Laptop for Kids. This computer was perfect for my middle school boys' e-learning. I was surprised by how small it was, but the body can easily sit anywhere in the house and get their work done. I would not recommend for an adult though. I have small hands and found the keyboard too small for me. But for kids GO FOR IT!",
"Super slow operating system. I was able to return it and get a full refund which is great, but I would not recommend this. I don't game or anything, just normal internet browsing etc. After a few weeks this computer wouldn't even play a show on Netflix without constantly buffering.",
"Great to have for the price. What I don't like is,I wish that it wasn't windows. Easier to manipulated.over ALL K LOVE it.",
"Don\u2019t buy please. Save your money. Completely disappointed and dissatisfied with this laptop. Contacted seller. No response. Slow, uncooperative and won\u2019t even let you in on the installed applications. Totally a waste of money.",
"Does not power up. I bought this laptop less than 6 months ago and it does not power up any longer. Save your money, buy an Apple.",
"Perfect little Laptop. I've had my laptop for a few weeks now and it's beyond perfect. I own an e-com and a travel business and it's perfect .It's my FIRST laptop and I love it. No glitching, easy navigation, easy to upload and download important documents for my business. Screen is awesome as well as the battery life. I highly recommend this product.",
"Great for the mobile software engineer. This laptop has all the spec that I need for the non-compute intensive tasks of my day as a software engineer. I love having this one for when I'm on the go, but I still want to be in my editor.",
"Nice for the price. We got this mainly for my son to do online schooling. We\u2019ve had no issues thus far with it. Nice little computer for the price!",
"It\u2019s decent,,,,. I got this as a quick laptop to use for drawing. It works okay,,, every few days I get a blue screen and it takes 20 mins each time to troubleshoot it. Other then that I haven\u2019t had any issues with running the program I use for drawing and no issues with compatibility with my drawing monitor. It\u2019s decent but if I had a chance to buy I different one I definitely would.",
"Great for the price!. Great little laptop for what I use for. So far perfect easy set up\ud83d\udc4d Screen quality good and overall perfect for me",
"Slow AF out of the box. I bought this laptop just to do college work on, as soon as i set it up i downloaded chrome and the laptop is struggling to close 1 tab. I expect more from asus but i guess nothing is as good as it used to be. Kind of disappointed because im sure ill have to buy another one within the next year. Save your money and buy an HP or mac.",
"recommended!!. when i was writing this review it says touch screen??? i dont think mine is touch screen??? i mean ill try it later but ???? lol other than that its a really good computer. i was in need for one badly and this solved my problems.",

"Pretty impressive. It's very lightweight, for a 4GB is pretty fast and responsive, the speakers are okay, and is easy to modify.",
"GREAT PRODUCT. This is a beautiful machine. The set up was so smooth. Just note that this is a notebook so it is smaller than a regular laptop",

"Very nice small laptop. My daughter is using the laptop to take notes in her classes. She is very happy with it.",
"Military. Not touch screen. Does the job. Cheap. Fast on/off. Held up during travel. No software add ins needed w/purchase. Insert cac reader works right away",
"PIECE of JUNK - WASTE OF $$$ - DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. It is a piece of junk and customer service is AWFUL.",
"Well worth the money for basic everyday use.. It's a great laptop for basic everyday computer needs. For the money you can't beat it. The only real issue for me is that it does not get along well with my Google accounts. Obviously I know, but for the money I figured I'd make it work. Worst part was syncing my work and personal email which are both Gmail. Other than that it's a winner.",
"Worth every penny!. Brought for grandson for school. User friendly, light weight. He loves it",
"Not a good buy. The computer continue to cut off and on. Even if the battery is fully charge and shut off properly after use, once logged on for class it would restart on its own.",
"doesnt work properly. MY keyboard doesnt work good. it gets blocked many times, and some keys of the keyboard do not work. i have to wait or reset my computer. Really disappointed",
"Thank God, Finally a Good Netbook!. We've been buying netbooks for over 10 years, and this is the first one that works as smoothly as my MacBook. If you're like us and prefer to do certain tasks on a PC, I would highly recommend this inexpensive but smooth netbook. Shout-out to Asus for taking pride in their product.",
"Great product and price!. What's not to like! Once I removed the S Version from the software I was able to put what I wanted on the computer! Great product and price!",
"It works well and is cheap. Bought this so my son can do home schooling during the corona health crisis. It\u2019s worked great. Local storage is small but for what we needed it didn\u2019t matter. Boots quick. Decent processor. Windows based. No issues.",
"Simpl. I am very impressed with the simplicity of this device! It has all the features of a computer that has a mouse!",
"Save your money and time!. I would not recommend this computer at all. I ordered this computer for my 12 years old grandson's remote learning school. My grandson experienced so much problems with this device. I ordered this computer in August 2020 and by the end of October 2020 the device crashed and would not start. I had to buy another computer (different brand) for my grandson.",
"Awesome device. This mini laptop accomplishes the objectives for a common user that needs a device for surfing, video watching, text editing and other basic tasks that any person needs on everyday situation. I recommend it !!!!!",
"Exceptionally poor audio. Lap top was purchased in order to use it for distance teaching and other zoom meetings. This laptop has absolutely the worst audio I have ever experienced. It was scratchy and cracking up, etc. Totally useless for my purposes. Attempted to send it back. That didn't happen. My advice; save your money, cross this one off your list. Willie",
"GREAT PRODUCT!!!!. I really love this laptop!! I was looking for a laptop for work and school, this was perfect. Even though, in the preview the screen looks small it actually quite big and the battery life is fantastic. I am able to go almost two days without having to charge?!?!?",
"Nice size. Seems durable and works great for roblocks among whatever games my daughter enjoys",
"Not for the Professional. The quality video quality during zoom or google meets is not good. The sound however is spectacular. The company advertises up to 10hrs of battery. Emphasis must be placed on that up to. I begin work at 7:45am and by lunch (11:30am) the battery is down to 7%. It gets the job done but I better video on my bulky acer chromebook.",
"Worth every penny. Great battery life, I love this little computer, I don't care that it doesn't have a touch screen. Great price, longbattery life, does everything I need it to. I don't game.",
"Bad experience. I received two tablets instead of two laptops. Unsatisfied.",
"Broke after one week.. This didn\u2019t even last a week before it wouldn\u2019t charge or boot. Tried to exchange for the same one and was told they were out of stock and I couldn\u2019t exchange. Forced to get credited and buy something more expensive. Ridiculous!",
"Buyer beware- the manufacturer's warranty is only for 6 months and the charger is a piece of junk. It stopped working after a month of using it. I didn't start using the computer until about 5 months after purchasing it because I had it shipped overseas and didn't get a chance to pick it up right away. I didn't think it would be a problem not testing the product after receiving it right away figuring the warranty was for 12 months.",
"Na. Too small and slow",
"So far, seems to be a great little machine, trouble free, user friendly. No touch screen...but otherwise very efficient.",

"Decent but having issues turning on. I bought this small laptop for some lighht writing work. It works ok, even tho i feel 300 was a bit too much for it. I've had it for at max a month now and it is having trouble turning on. Not sure why this is happening , especially when i've only had it for such a short time. If this continue's I'm definitely gonna take this up with Asus.",

"very slow internet connection. Very slow internet access compared to the other laptops I have",

"Slow. This thing takes 30 mins to restart after downloading an update. Unacceptable.",
"Do not buy!. Do not buy! I should have trusted the other reviews. Mine did not come with the 365 and Asus as well as Amazon were unable to help. Over 2 hours of trying to get a resolution to only return it and buy a new one elsewhere.",

"State of the Art, a very impressive machine, NOT for gaming. This is a well built, very impressive machine. Web browsing, navigation programs, stock trading, school, light video applications. NO fan, very low heat. Very light. The back panel appears to be glass filled polycarbonate. The high resolution, matte screen is very sturdy, not at all flimsy. Outstanding price, although I noticed it went up today. These only stay in stock for a couple of days, you have to check the Asus Store every day. Excellent keyboard, keypad, there were no cons found. Also noticed was how well Win10 has become with adjusting text size at higher resolutions. There are a lot of different settings to use, depending upon the application. This laptop will withstand abuse, perfect for school. Spec is 12 hour battery, light use shows 8 hours. This is a very low power, but very useful, machine. UPDATE: no programs running, 12 hours; navigation program running, including USB GPS, 6.5 hours, on line full screen surf cam, 4.5 hours. Click on the battery icon on the lower right and the popup screen will tell you how much time is left based on the current program load. UPDATE: Note that it is easy and free to exit restrictive S mode and enter Win10 Home without having to download anything. After entering Win10 Home, there will be approx 30GB left on the SSD.",
"Perfect for travel. For travel purposes, I need a laptop that weights under 1kg so I can carry it around in my daypack, and which doesn't cost much, so if it's broken or stolen, it's not a great loss. I used to have the Asus X205ta, which fit the bill well, except with only 32GB of storage there was barely enough space for Windows 10 and MS Office. I had been searching for something similar with more storage, and finally came across this one, with 64GB of storage. Yes, it's not very powerful, but I just need it for work (MS Office) and internet, not for anything heavy like gaming or video editing. It's something I can grab and take backpacking with me so I can get work done while on the road. Mine came with Windows 10 Home, which suits my needs fine. Oh, and the sound is superior to that of the X205ta. Call me happy.",
"Just what it's supposed to be. This is a fine, tiny computer. The keyboard is nice, easier to use for my large hands than I thought it would be. The screen is not the super high def, but on an 11.6 it looks good. The Celeron n4000 processor seems to be a little beefier than most of their versions. I have streamed video's and multi tasked with no problems. I am not a gamer. The reviews that said you had to pay for a full version of Windows 10 home are wrong. You can remove Windows 10 s and put a full version on in minutes. Just Google how to do it. It's Free. I have done it with mine for Chrome and some other stuff. My Google Docs from the Chrome browser allows me to change docs to Word docs, so no issues there. I have to worry a little more about security, but it is handling running everything just fine. I gave it 4 stars because the touch pad is a little janky at times, with the cursor wiggling around a bit. But then it settles down and is manageable. It's very light and nice looking too. The speakers are on the bottom, but it's understandable with a computer this small. They are not bad for this price point. If you want something more powerful than this, then pay more. For my needs, it has been a very nice machine.",
"Great portable laptop for Linux. I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop had a broken screen, and I did not want to pay much for a laptop I really only use for light internet browsing and coding. I also would never consider running Windows on a machine that is this limited. That being said, it's perfect for Linux. I lose the ability to use the number pad on the trackpad, but I never wanted that feature anyways. I'm mainly posting this review for anyone else who is considering Linux, because getting the wireless to work wasn't trivial. Namely, I could not find any drivers for it in Debian. Thus, I installed Manjaro (Arch) Linux, and used the rtl8821ce-dkms-git driver and firmware from the Arch User Repository (AUR). With that, after restarting, it worked perfectly. I'm using the built-in SSD for my boot, swap, and /, while using a micro SD card for /home. I really enjoy the form factor, and things are pretty snappy on Linux with it.",
"1 year disposable laptop. I ordered this laptop from my brothers account. It was fairly functional for the first year. kept the data mostly on SD Cards to prevent build up on the system. I was a student primarily using for word docs, viewing files, watching videos. its nice and portable. The biggest problem from the get go was i couldn't charge this laptop while working or the screen would black out and stop operating until the battery was completely dead, so I'd have to let it die then let it fully charge before using... I needed a computer though now and couldn't wait for returning and getting a new unit so i just rolled with it. If I was working hard the battery wouldn't last terribly long so It forced me to take breaks after long uses. So after the year it just couldn't handle multitasking and basic functions, I had done multiple scans to see if there were issues or viruses but no problems... so it's not functional at this point, I would not recommend at all. I wished i knew it wouldn't last because my bros laptops have been lasting several years but they paid at least 2-3x the up front costs. I suppose you shouldn't cheap out if you can on these things.",
"Check Model number on package before opening. I was sent the L203M instead of L203MA. Touchscreen is the only reason I bought it as opposed to other devices in the same price range. The L203MA model - this item - is touchscreen, but I was sent the non-touchscreen model i.e. L203M. Looking at other recent 2020 reviews, it looks like this practice has been going on for most of this period. I'm returning mine immediately.",
"basically a windows tablet. flash memory not as good as SSD, Windows S allows only apps from microsoft store, it's not really a \"computer\" more like a tablet with a keyboard that runs Windows...you can upgrade to Windows Pro for $50 though and that's great considering its $100 to upgrade from Windows Home to Pro...get this for someone who doesn't know a lot about computers and just wants to get online",
"Terrible customer sevice. Do not waste your money in Asus products. they have very poor customer service. I sent my laptop for repair for more than a month. every time I call them for status update , answer is your laptop is waiting for part. apparently they shipping all spare parts from china and waiting time is very long. customer service is very important because ASUS laptops breaking down really quick. As soon as computer warranty expiring it will get break down . the problem of ASUS laptop is black screening randomly. quality of material used in screen is very very poor.",
"Good for email and web surfing, not gaming. Got this for my wife. She uses it for email, web surfing and Zoom meetings, and is quite satisfied with it. She also uses it with a blue tooth speaker for music for worship, which also fills the need. She did not want a touch screen, none here, so she was happy with what she got.",
"Best laptop for the money ive ever spent. I had a credit for around $200.00 from amazon when I found this laptop. I wasn't expecting much out of this product I just wanted something I could carry in my work van and be able to look up parts and material for my home improvement business. This is the 4th laptop I have bought to keep with me onsite. This is the best laptop by far I have used in the field. As long as I have an internet signal or can hotspot my phone I feel like I can do anything from this that I can do from my office desktop. In the end I only paid around $35.00 out of pocket after I used my amazon credits. Could not of found a better way to spend my credits.",
"Great buy for college students!. I had to give it 0 stars for touchscreen because it does not have one and gaming because I do not game and I would not know, but this computer otherwise is fantastic!! As a college student, I bought the cheapest quality laptop I could get and I definitely picked the right one! I have never had a problem with this computer and I have been using daily for almost four months now! It is compact and lightweight which is really nice! I also am I communications major and it works brilliantly with my video editing applications!",
"Look for an AMD equally priced.. Price now at 300. Amd is a better choice at this price point. I know what type of user this machines hardware is rated for but at the price of 300 not great or good for that matter. Intels cpus that aren't part of the I series. Are just crap. Graphics. What graphics. 4 gb of Ram. Crap. Ssd is speedy so as long you can maintain not download a thing. Once you start downloading zip files or anything that needs to be extracted you'll see how the drive fails you.",
"Reliable, awful sound, not a great gaming laptop. I mostly wanted to write this review to ensure everyone knows that the internal speakers on this laptop are unusable. They are found underneath the laptop and it is impossible to watch any video on this laptop, because I cannot hear it at all. I also cannot play any game above low quality graphics because my fan becomes a jet engine and the game becomes unplayable.",
"5 stars. Very nice and compact laptop. Amazing for the price. This is the perfect back to school laptop for all ages. I was a little wary at first when shopping because I thought it was too good to be true for the price, however it was worth the risk!",
"Slow laptop. One of the worst laptops ever. I bought this cheap laptop for my parents but it is so incredibly slow. Even with a single tab in a browser open, it freezes. Maybe I got a faulty one, but the ones I have is basically unusable.",
"Entry level. Item is a small entry level machine for kids.... If you want a strong powerful machine with all the perks then pay more for a bigger machine. The kids love it so I like it.",
"Nice and good price. My son got one for his birthday and loves it and if had the money I would buy my self one ! Love how easy and very nice it is.",
"Waste of money. Had it for a day then the next day it turned off and never worked again. Then I called customer service they didn\u2019t know anything they blamed it on me.",
"Not a Touchscreen as described. This was specifically described as being a touch screen which was one of the only freaking reasons I bought it. I bought it for a child doing schooling at home this year as a gift and I am so upset. Amazon you really need to make your sellers work on their descriptions and actually describe things correctly!!!!!!!",
"Perfect for college freshman!. Got this computer for my first year at college and it is a perfect size! It hooks up to my hotspot just fine and I had no problems setting it up. It doesn\u2019t have any issues and runs perfectly fine. I would definitely recommend for college students.",
"Would recommend. I love this product for its price! It is super lightweight. Works perfect traveling back and forth between classes. Overall a great product. The only reason it didn\u2019t get 5/5 stars for battery life is because it has died quickly on me a handful of times. Otherwise a great product!!",
"Bad. This computer was very slow and kept exiting out of the web and had to start over multiple times. I returned it after 4 days.",
"RIP-OFF. They keep making the price higher PLUS you have to pay monthly it\u2019s not worth it 300+ dollars and monthly payments is a ripoff",
"No thanks. It's really small and light which is great for travel, but the storage really sucks and I have a really hard time getting the mouse pad work everytime... I'm really not happy with it, it's really tiny and sucks",
"Fake OS product key. As the laptop worked the way it should, the OS did not appear to be genuine. The laptop came in S more as advertised, however when I attempted to revert to regular win10 I was met with an error that the product key was invalid. Most disappointing.",
"Good value laptop. Nice entry level laptop for basic everyday functions and value. I love that it includes a solid state drive for the cost and the picture quality in the screen is unbeatable.",
"Good buy. I like everything about it. :)",
"Waste of money. Waste of money",
"Google Chrome. Can you use google chrome?",
"Don't buy this. Sucks",
"Excellent lite-weight Laptop for the Price. Got tired of carrying the weight of my 14\" Lenovo Ideapad laptop when travelings so purchased this to take on trips, happy to find a Windows laptop in this size (11 in display), as I didn't want to go with a Chromebook. So far I'm very happy with it - actually much much happier than I thought I would be, as I've found it not to be much of a compromise in having the smaller screen. First off, it is light, though not too small in size. The display, in my opinion, is excellent; and I'm also very happy with the size and feel of the keyboard. The mouse pad is not perfect (an occasional stutter in following my finger movement) but works fine 99% of the time). I immediately added a 256mb mini-SD card so it now has plenty of storage and I also did the upgrade to Win 10 Home (Pro was not an option, but also not required for my use). It was very easy to setup so most new apps download and run from the added SD (now drive D) storage, so after downloading my main program requirements, including the Fire Fox browser and Thunderbird mail client, and several others, I still have nearly 38GB of the 64GB internal memory remaining. It is now an exact mini-version of my larger laptop as to the Win 10 Home OS look and operation and my program requirements, in all aspects, even down to my custom desktop image which was automatically transferred to this computer doing setup. The computer also came loaded with a 1 year subscription to MS Office which is useful. Update 21 June 2020 - I've now been using this laptop off and on for nearly 9 months and recently updated to Windows 10 version 2004, a fairly major OS update that has caused issues with many computers. The update on this laptop went very smoothly on first attempt, much better than on my Lenovo Ideapad which was left with several problems after update, and which took 5 attempts to get it loaded. I've now installed all the apps that I need/use when traveling, which is the main purpose for this laptop, and still have 26.1GB out of the 51.6GB available in internal storage, plus 237GB of the 249GB on the SD card I added. The small issue I had with occasional pointer stuttering my finger movement using the track pad appears to have gone away - now operates smoothly following finger moments when pointing and scrolling, but replaced with one where on a few sites when attempting to scroll using the arrow keys it doesn't - not sure it's a laptop problem or a site problem, and if the arrow keys don't work, the track pad scrolling does. For my main uses of web surfing, with a few tabs on my Firefox browser open - often using Google search and Google Maps, receiving/sending email, and WeChat conversations, it's every bit as good as my Lenovo Ideapad with it's much more powerful Intel Core I7 Processor. Overall, I'm still very 5 star happy with this laptop given it's excellent screen display, speed in loading and using apps, lite-weight and low purchase price.",
"Good for a writer on the go. Perfect for writing and quick internet access when you need to install your own software but don't want to shell out the big bucks for a full sized laptop. It's lightweight, decent speakers, and fits in an oversized purse or small backpack. The keyboard is tinier than a full sized one but any keyboard fit for an 11.6'' screen would be. This beats buying a tablet and keyboard for me. I suggest buying this as a secondary travel laptop and not as a primary PC unless all you want to do is surf the web and install a few small programs.",
"3 Months of light use and now won't turn on. What a piece of junk! I bought this for my kid in elementary school. It has ONLY been used for remote learning which is like one program and only a small handful of webpages- so very light use. Went to turn it on today and the power light was on but it won't do ANYTHING. The screen won't turn on, I can't get it to restart- nothing. What an absolute waste of money! Not to mention he put a bunch of his favorite stickers on it thinking he'd have it for at least a couple years- and now those also need to be replaced$$$ Save yourself a headache and don't waste your money on this piece of junk! And since we're on the subject, this thing is also comically small- like the size of a tablet. Just crap.",
"Perfect laptop for students!. Bought 3 of these for my siblings for high-school. Perfectly compact, easy to carry around, but not too small so that you can\u2019t view the screen. Easy to use, they were able to set them up all on their own. Shipping was fast, no complaints with the seller \ud83d\ude42 great for the price. I didn\u2019t try to set up any gaming on them, but probably won\u2019t as there isn\u2019t a lot of space, probably not a big enough screen or hard drive for gaming, but I could be wrong. Overall great little laptops, great for teens or students. It came with Microsoft for 1 year, which was greatly appreciated and will be put to use",
"Fine for the price. I have had this about a week and so far so good. It functions fine as a slightly more powerful than average netbook, but it is certainly not capable of moderately demanding tasks. Overall it is good for the price and intended application.",
"Pretty great!. I just needed a laptop for basic needs. Watching shows and movies, managing my stores and stuff like that. It's pretty great for any of that. Not sure how it would handle gaming. But if you need a good office work laptop or for basic entertainment, this is a pretty good deal!",
"10/10. This was a very good purchase. The laptop is a nice size and everything works perfectly so far. It also has a space for a sd card if you want/need more space than the laptop provides. All in all I would defiantly purchase this laptop for a second time if I had to.",
"Buy this now!. This is a great computer for the money. I was skeptical about buying a computer online but was pleasantly surprised. The product description was accurate.",
"Superthin and lightweight. What a pleasure to work on this laptop, the battery is very good so you can easily use it during the day without charging, really love it, definitely \ud83d\udc4d",
"Easy set up, light weight, long battery life. I got these laptops for my kids which are homeschooling. The battery last ALL day which is a huge huge plus. The laptop was easy to set up and is very light weight. Screen has nice image, so perfect for doing work or watching videos.",
"Great Investment. I purchased this laptop for my son. He loves it. The screen has awesome clarity. My son loves it.",
"Great. Wonderful",
"Worth it. I don\u2019t know why people complain about it, I\u2019ve been using for few months for work and it\u2019s working like magic never got any problems with it! It\u2019s light easy to carry around and the battery life is good longer than bigger laptops. Overall I would highly recommend it",
"good value. good performance",
"Perfect as a back-up for work at Home. Perfect. But remember small screen",
"Great little notebook. Great price. I use it a lot.",
"A very good product. The size is perfect for my granddaughter to do school work. I should have purchased a touch screen. However for now, it will do.",
"Overall ok slow processing. Slow processing.",
"Just right for what it was needed. Small lightweight and easy to use perfect",
"Very simple transaction. Excellent delivery time .. My grandson for school.",
"Great deal would recommend!. So far very happy! Buy an external mouse the pad isn't super responsive but I don't use it much anyways it works when I need to print something off and didn't bring my mouse with me. I went for the higher gig and I wouldn't have done it any other way after reading through all the reviews online. I spent a great deal of time trying to find an affordable laptop that was actually a laptop and not a Chromebook as those do not run with windows10 and do not have the capabilities of a standard laptop depending on your needs after a very long time I decided on this and I am extremely happy so far that I did especially with the included windows 10 and office 360 I really don't know you can get a better deal than this just remember before buying the actual size of this laptop is very small so if you want something big this isn't your deal however its size makes it perfect for travel and lugging around!",
"Small, Relatively Lightweight, Gets the Job Done. As Expected.. Overall this is what I wanted/needed. I was primarily looking for something small and lightweight that I can use to edit papers (grad student/copy editor). It isn't super fast or fancy but it works well, carries easy, and looks nice. The track pad isn't super responsive but that hasn't been too much of an issue because I use a mouse, but might be annoying for others.",
"ASUS L203MA-DS04 + Office + Windows. ENGLISH: Be aware that the included Office is Office 365 Personal, meaning a subscription-based version, and they give you only one year free. But still, it might be worth it, because the subscription includes OneDrive storage and 60 min/month of Skype to Phone calling. By the way, the included Windows 10 is in S mode. But this is not really a problem, because when you try to install any 3rd-party software, you will see a screen asking you if you want to switch out of S mode. The switch is free. FRAN\u00c7AIS : Sachez que l'Office inclus est Office 365 Personnel, c'est-\u00e0-dire une version sur abonnement, et qu'il ne vous offre qu'un an gratuit. Mais \u00e7a peut quand m\u00eame valoir le coup, car l'abonnement inclut du stockage OneDrive et 60 minutes/mois d'appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques Skype. Par ailleurs, le Windows 10 inclus est en mode S.

Attention, les sp\u00e9cifications sont tr\u00e8s minimales pour Windows 10 et la majorit\u00e9 des critiques n\u00e9gatives tiennent de cet aspect. C'est toutefois un excellent appareil pour la bureautique, navigation Internet et travaux scolaires des enfants. Je n'ai pas essay\u00e9 Windows, j'ai imm\u00e9diatement install\u00e9 Linux \u00e0 la place. Selon ma compr\u00e9hension, le syst\u00e8me d'origine est Windows 10 S, ne permettant d'installer que des applications sign\u00e9es par Microsoft, avec possibilit\u00e9 de passer \u00e0 une licence Windows 10 Home gratuitement. Acc\u00e8s facile au BIOS avec F2 pour d\u00e9sactiver Secure Boot et d\u00e9marrer sur cl\u00e9 USB. J'ai d\u00e9marr\u00e9 sur un Live USB et fait une image int\u00e9grale (dd) sur une cl\u00e9 USB3 en environ 1 heure. J'ai essay\u00e9 ElementaryOS et Xubuntu qui fonctionnaient parfaitement bien. Touches FN pour luminosit\u00e9, volume, etc. fonctionnaient tr\u00e8s bien. Tourne les vid\u00e9os YouTube 1080P sans probl\u00e8me gr\u00e2ce au GPU int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au processeur.

Webcam SD (non HD), qualit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s moyenne mais correcte pour une utilisation occasionnelle. Libreoffice et VLC tournent aussi parfaitement bien.

Si vous avez faite vos recherches et \u00eates conscients des limites de ce syst\u00e8me avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son achat, vous devriez en \u00eatre pleinement satisfait. ------------------------------ The model I received is L203MA-DS04. 2-core CPU 2.6 GHz max with 8GB integrated GPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC storage, 2 USB3 ports + 1 USB-C. Keyboard is English only so keep that in mind if you needed French characters and don't know the proper key combinations by heart or you're buying for a French user. Take note that the specs are really minimalistic to run Windows 10 and most negative reviews about this laptop reflect that aspect. I didn't try Windows as I immediately installed Linux instead. From my understanding, the base system is Windows 10 S, which only allows to run software signed by Microsoft, although you are allowed to upgrade to Windows 10 Home for free. Easy access to the BIOS with F2 key to deactivate Secure Boot and boot from USB drive. I booted on a live USB and made a disc image (dd) on USB3 within about an hour. I tried ElementaryOS and Xubuntu, both ran exceptionally well. Function keys for brightness, volume, etc. were supported without any problems. I played YouTube videos on 1080P without any problem thanks to the CPU's integrated GPU. Using Chromecast from Chrome/Chromium was not a problem. Sound quality is ok and loud enough at max setting. Trackpad isn't the best of its kind but does the job for the price and is easily mitigated with a wireless mouse. Webcam is standard d\u00e9finition (non-HD) a quality was average but still ok for the occasional use. Libreoffice and VLC also ran without any issue. Please take note: installing Linux from a Live USB is relatively easy if you have experienced it before. However, if you don't have the knowledge to make a disc image of the entire drive beforehand (hint: dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/cleusb/image.dd), removing Windows will be irreversible. You won't be able to get it back and that's not the kind of situation that would be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. If you have done your research properly and are aware of its limitations before buying, you should be plenty satisfied.",

"Not bad for the price.. Bought this laptop mainly for school and for watching tv shows or youtube. Videos may lag once in a while because the processor is not too great. and 4 gigs of ram is not enough for chrome. Great laptop for web browsing, writing papers and some very low end games.",
"Very nice for the price. Extremely light and portable, fits great on airplane trays, fast enough to run chrome with multiple extension (4gb model). The keyboard is nice and does not flex like the other Asus 11.6 from the previous years. Love that it's using a micro SD and not a full size SD that stick out like every other laptop this size. Very lous speakers but no bass at all. The only downside is the screen viewing angle is quite bad and the battery is only good for 5 hours. Would love to see the same laptop with IPS display and 12 hours battery for 100$ more. USB C charging wouls also be great.",
"Excelente producto b\u00e1sico para necesidades b\u00e1sicas. La compr\u00e9 con un descuento de bonificaci\u00f3n bancaria, y me parece que es exactamente lo que necesitaba.

Le puse una tarjeta SD de 64 GB clase 10 para que guardara archivos temporales y descargas de internet. Incluso he podido abrir sin problemas programas de edici\u00f3n b\u00e1sica de im\u00e1genes. Puedo usarla en la escuela y es super ligera. Definitivamente es un producto b\u00e1sico, pero cumple al 100% si tus necesidades son b\u00e1sicas y tienes idea de c\u00f3mo evitar que una computadora se haga lenta (eliminaci\u00f3n de cach\u00e9, eliminaci\u00f3n de archivos temporales, etc.).",
"I'm loving it. This laptop is perfect. I have a hard drive and good monitor for home use and it's so lightweight and fast I'm really enjoying it. Obviously I chose the best of the options but I use my machines constantly and need then to handle and keep up and so far Asus has me impressed.",
"Good battery deacent screen good for youngens. Works just fine a little on the slow side works fine though. You can run pretty much any application as long as its not performance heavy. Any kids/teens looking for a cheap way to play windows games this might not be for you though it can run roblox ok counterstrike ok in the low 30 fps range i wouldent get your hopes up and on the very liwest setting on unreal tournament it can run at 28 fps. Spread sheets pdfs anything work related other than cad rendering large or particularly detailed videos and most intensive tasks arent reccomended. Overall its a pretty good laptop if your on the cheap and dont want a chromebook for school or just watching youtube its a great laptop i will say that the screen isnt great but its functional also the keyboard has no backlight so its a little difficult to use in the dark. Battery life in practice its probably like 6 hours idk in that range. If you get this laptop id reccomend going into your windows license and turning off windows 10s it lets you install applications from outside the Microsoft store anyway thanks for ready my poorly structured review. Ciao",
"Asus L210 is a keeper!. I was in the market for a budget, tiny and good looking laptop for my every now and then computing requirements. Most of my everyday computing needs are taken care of by an Acer desktop which is a beast. So, I didn't need a powerful laptop. All I wanted was one that is as small as possible and doesn't cost much. Luckily, I found this laptop. I picked the 11.6 inch one that runs on Intel 4020. First impressions are extremely pleasant. It looks and feels good, doesn't feel 250 dollar cheap. It can easily pass off as much costlier one. The design is very minimalist and very practical, also fairly sturdy. The screen is decent for the price (I have realistic expectations. Some reviews complain about display but I don't see the point.)and the device is fan-less which is a big plus for me. Since I already have a primary computer, I am leaving this in S mode. The boot times are real quick, almost close to Surface's instant on speeds. In my limited use, the battery seems to hold very well. It can last all day with low to medium usage is my guess. My only gripe about the device is the memory. I wish they had put a SSD instead of eMMC. But again, this is not a complaint but wishful thinking. I knew it only had eMMC memory when I bought it. The model number made me believe that the keyboard is backlit but it isn't. It is not a huge deal breaker for me. I wasn't expecting a backlit keyboard in a CA$250 laptop. There is certainly some confusion with model numbers. May be another variant of this base model has backlit keyboard. Amazon might have to take a look at the product page to make sure the information about the laptop is right to avoid unnecessary negative reviews. One other detail they need to check is mention of touchscreen feature. While writing the review, it asked me to rate the touchscreen. That's weird because this isn't a touchscreen laptop. Again, another reason for unnecessary negative reviews. In my honest opinion, anyone buying a 250 dollar laptop shouldn't be expecting a touchscreen, FHD screen or backlit keyboard. You get what you pay for. All said and done, this is a very good laptop for CA$250 (including taxes). I will not pay more than that for the device. At this price, this is one of the best bang for your buck device. A perfect choice, if you are looking for a secondary device for light task, or for school use.",

La bater\u00eda permite utilizarla todo el d\u00eda sin preocuparse por cargarla de nuevo y en general se trata de un equipo completamente port\u00e1til. En mi experiencia es bastante capaz con distribuciones de linux y una memoria sd para ampliar el almacenamiento.",
"Great Little Computer but Amazon Help has been totally Hopeless. I've had this computer now for over week. It's exactly what I need for work. It's light weight, decent keyboard and screen. However, it comes with Microsoft Office which requires a product key to activate it. They key was not included and I've been dealing with Amazon help for over a week having multiple chats and multiple emails to get the key code. Each time it appears things are resolved, I find out they aren't. The level of incompetence at Amazon's help desk is incredible. I've now spent hours trying to resolve this. They're trying to send me to Asus and Microsoft. Of course they won't have any record of this transaction. Amazon has offered to send me a new computer. That's an incredible waste of time and energy and there's no guarantee that a replacement would come with a key. How difficult is it to send me a key? I can recommend the computer, I really like it, but suggest if you are interested in the software package that comes with it to look elsewhere.",
"Not touchscreen.. It\u2019s not a touchscreen model, however if it\u2019s supposed to be then the one I received wasn\u2019t. Its a great little unit for Netflix, the online shopping browsing and the minimal tasks. This laptop could not handle anything big but it would do well for a kids homework computer. If you are looking to run big programs or run major projects this isn\u2019t the unit. Overall, its a decent machine for the price.",
"great little laptop for daily business tasks. I purchased this laptop as it was just being understood that working from home was going to be for an extended period of time. This laptop is light, good feedback on the keyboard, and great for simple tasks of email writing, word documents, PDFs etc. Screen is OK, and can handle Netflix, twitch other streaming platforms. This Camera is not much but can get you through in much lighter backgrounds. The sensor does not work well in very low light situations. Do not expect to look 10/10 on your Zoom/Webex meetings. For the price to have a Windows 10 Laptop, it cannot be beat, with the decent build quality of ASUS.",
"The Breaker of Chargers. I'm writing this review on my phone because this laptop is dead. The charger it came with charged it 3 times then stopped working. So I bought another charger from Amazon, and it broke too. Not sure what's happening here, but I'm annoyed. But hey, if you like buying new chargers every time this laptop dies, then this is the laptop for you!",
"very slow. very slow",
"Nice little laptop. It\u2019s works perfect for what I need, just normal everyday use and streaming, battery lasts long and it\u2019s super light, it does get a little warm on the lap but not to hot, screen brightness is great can\u2019t go wrong for the price",
"Fine desktop computer/bon ordinateur de travail. I buyed this computer 6 months ago to work on the bus. Working mainly with music sheets (Musescore) and Word. The computer is working great so far. It does all a computer with these specs are supposed to do. Don't expect to play videogames (if you want that, don't buy a PC with 64 GB of space disk/4 GB RAM with poor processor and graphic card) or run a lot of tasks at the same time : it's NOT a multitasking computer. However, it's really lightweight, so really nice when you want to do simple tasks in the transport. *** J'ai achet\u00e9 cet ordinateur il y a 6 mois pour travailler dans l'autobus. Je travaille principalement avec des partitions (Musescore) et Word. L'ordinateur fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant. Il r\u00e9pond tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 ce qu'on peut attendre d'un ordinateur avec ces sp\u00e9cifications. Ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 des jeux vid\u00e9os (si vous voulez jouer \u00e0 ces jeux, n'achetez PAS un ordinateur comprenant 64 GB d'espace disque/4 GB de RAM et un processor et une carte graphique m\u00e9diocres) ou \u00e0 faire plusieurs t\u00e2ches en m\u00eame temps sur cet ordinateur : ce n'est pas un ordi pour faire rouler plusieurs programmes et pages web \u00e0 la fois. Par contre, le poids tr\u00e8s l\u00e9ger de l'ordinateur le rend tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 transporter et plaisant pour ceux et celles qui souhaitent avoir un ordinateur pour faire des t\u00e2ches de base dans le transport.",
"Light, good battery life, value for money!. I use this as an extra laptop for work. Battery life has been pretty good, able to last a full work day on just surfing, using Office programs and some video clips. Although it's not as slim as depicted in pictures, it is fairly light and resistant to scratches. I'm loving it so far and no regrets on this purchase. Should have gotten this instead of a MacBook when I was studying, serves its purpose and costs 10x less. If there is one thing I would change, it would be the font on the keyboard..",
"Una excelente netbook de entrada. La computadora inicia muy r\u00e1pido, su hardware la hace perfecta para tareas de ofim\u00e1tica y algunas aplicaciones ligeras, excelente para reproducir v\u00eddeos, el puerto HDMI tama\u00f1o normal se agradece. La recomiendo ampliamente. Viene activada en modo S-Mode, pero este se puede desactivar de una forma muy sencilla para poder instalar cualquier tipo de software.",
"Defective. Took a long time to arrive (I understood during peak covid times in May/June) Worked good for the first few months, all of a sudden it won't turn on even when charging. It's was not dropped or damaged in anyway so makes no sense as to why it suddenly just won't turn on. Called the support number rang for 5 min no one picked up, online support is garbage. Super unhappy and extremely inconvenient to go without especially during these times.",
"Good for schoolwork. This is a great computer for schoolwork. It is lightweight and portable. The downside is that the the it does lag from time to time, including the cursor. Furthermore, it cannot handle heavy work and many files. However, it works well to for school work since it is easy to carry around. I recommend using it for writing essays, making presentations, and internet browsing.",
"Great for the price!. Using this for my business' Quickbooks Premier. Working great and very happy with the product. Would have like side number keyboard, but no big deal. Liked the smaller compact size.",
"Buena para ofim\u00e1tica. Me gust\u00f3 el tama\u00f1o y el peso de la laptop, la verdad no esperaba mucho, s\u00f3lo que se pudiera usar para lo b\u00e1sico de office, para otras cosas ir\u00eda muy lenta y el \u00fanico detalle es que para prenderla tienes que apretar fuerte el bot\u00f3n por aproximadamente un segundo.",
"Excellent quality. Love it. Screen is a bit small for a laptop but otherwise perfect for home use. I'm retired so don't know about business applications.",
"I love it, but no touch screen. I love this laptop, I had to send it in for repairs due to a keyboard issue but besides that it's amazing. I have been unable to get touch screen to work though and actually seems not to have touch screen. UPDATE: 3 months down the line, it actually starts slowing down",
"Decent machine.. Is not bad for what it is. I ama little annoyed with being forced to use the microsoft edge browser. Will not let me install chrome. Runs kind of slow but for the price it's not that bad.",
"Great Laptop for light use. Would like to have been able to add another stick of RAM but it is not possible. Will have to add external capacity. Otherwise I just love it",
"Go ahead and waste your time. Real review: I will keep it simple. Service was bad and my product was defective. Will never buy from this provider anymore.",
"Great little laptop!!. Great little laptop. Arrived 4 days later then the guaranteed delivery date. But the wait is worth it.",
"Ligera, c\u00f3mputo b\u00e1sico, \u00e1gil con Linux.. Me gusto pero sali\u00f3 defectuosa la pantalla y tuve que regresarla. El desempe\u00f1o es bueno para el procesador que incluye. Muy buena computadora para Linux. Conseguir\u00e9 esa computadora de nuevo.",
"Slim. I like the size of it, the screen quality and the speed!",
"It is a basic laptop computer but good value for the price!. A great little computer for someone who isn\u2019t big on technology or touchscreen! Works well for what he needed. Good value for the price!",
"Pretty good so far. It looks more expensive than a $300 laptop for sure. And so far the paltry celeron has been holding up with my excessive tabbing in chrome. Only downside is the terrible keyboard with little to no key travel",
"small size perfect for school. for my daughter. Perfect for school.",
"Pour le prix tr\u00e8s bon produit et rapide. Bon portable et de bonne qualit\u00e9",

"Rien. Je l\u2019aime bien pas plus",
"You won\u2019t think it is refurbished, looks like you brought it home from the Apple store. Ease of setup is amazing.. Looks brand new, wrapped and sealed in Apple packaging. Plugged it in and turned it on and let it go. Absolutely no problems, it was automatic and wonderful to have the computer set itself up. Has performed flawlessly as expected of an Apple laptop.",
"Machine possibly opened, cheap aftermarket charger. The laptop arrived in fair condition. The screws show signs of wear so it may have been opened up during the \"renewal\" process. Old stickers were left on the bottom. Also, the laptop was shipped with a cheap knockoff Chinese charger. I have no reason to trust this charger so I'll have to order a genuine Apple one instead. Fortunately I don't need this machine to be a workhorse or I would send it back. This should survive a year at least but I don't trust it as-is - I will wipe the hard disk, NVRAM, and SMC just to be safe.",
"Very disappointed with Mac purchase. I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase. I can't use the Mac because the hard drive was not reset and the software on the Mac dose not allow you to use it. Also there was no charger. Again very disappointed.",
"refurbished products are often faulty.. Product was faulty. The charging port wouldn't hold the plug. I returned it. I don't think the refurbishing process is very competent.",
"Great product!. Idk what I was thinking not having an apple in the first place. This laptop is very easy to use, fast, and I\u2019m excited to see how productive I can be with this format. I feel free, nothing holding me back now!! Unlike old pc with unresponsive interface, slow speeds, and constant crashes, this one gives me no problems!!",
"Great deal. This laptop was literally like brand new out of the box. So far my daughter is so thrilled with her graduation gift. She is ready for college now!!!",
"Great so far, I've had it for 3 months. This is exactly like the MacBook I was given for work that was stolen on a plane flight. No problems with this as a replacement so far, smooth sailing for 3 months already! I got the protection plan just in case, but I'm very satisfied with this cheaper than new replacement. Will update if there are any issues that arise. Would recommend.",
"Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive.. Our first ever Mac but so far its been quite impressive. It was easy to setup and get it going. It works well and very easy to use, turn on/off, carry around and day to day life. Wish the battery would last a bit longer.",
"Operating System is not Most Recent. I bought this for my daughter for school. The description states that this is the most recent version, which would lead me to believe the OS is the most recent, and it is not. She needed version 13, and in order to get that she needed to do two updates while at school. Before we realized this, she lost all of her work that she'd done up to this point because the OS was not compatible with Google Chrome (version 13 is), the computer froze, and she lost her work. She's an hour and a half away, so I had to troubleshoot a computer I was not familiar with from a distance. Hopefully it will work for her after doing these updates-it will be updating overnight so she won't even know if she can use it for her online class in the morning. I exchanged computers with her so she has no back up. So hopefully she is able to go to online class in the morning and IT can recover her lost work. Also-there were cheese puff crumbs on the keyboard, so I had to clean it with electronic wipes and electronics canned air before giving it to her. Very disappointing.",
"LOVE MY MAC AIR. i was a little leary. i had purchased 2 other macs that were refurbished and thy were both defective. i was so hppy that it tunrned on and didnt die within a week. this is a great computer and has never ffailed me. i love the mac book airs but there a bit pricey this was perfect. IT EVEN CAME IN THE MAC BOOK AIR BOX!!",
"Like new in box. This looks and feels brand new, came in original box with wrapped cords and instruction booklet. Love it.",
"Waste of money and my life ready to sue. Sold me a broken computer Keyboard don\u2019t work Mouse don\u2019t work Can\u2019t download things Reach out to seller no answer do not buy from them scam",
"Pretty good laptop. I bought this computer for my daughter to do her school assignments. Honestly, I was a little apprehensive at first, specially because it\u2019s a refurbished product, but so far it works pretty well. Battery life is good. I bought it on Sept, 28th and waited for a while to write a review just in case something goes wrong. So far, the laptop works great. It works and look like brand new besides a small dent ( please see second picture). It came in a plain box and generic charger. I\u2019d give a 5 star if it was a newer version. I\u2019ll update if something changes.",
"Nice computer- low end charger subbed in.. &nbsp;Package came in a neatly packaged box but the charger is an OEM charger which stopped working 3 weeks into use. (Loose coonection in the base and 2 prong plug-sparks when used) I have tried to contact seller through Amazon but no response and can't send the whole thing back as I need it for work. Bought a spare charger to replace the defective one. Can buy same item at Best Buy and NOT have the warranty - return issues. Won't buy from this seller again.",
"Affordable Solid Purchase I am happy. I purchased an Apple 13in MacBook Air, 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 Dual Core Processor, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, Mac OS, Silver, MQD32LL/A (Newest Version) (Renewed) mine was a 2017. It arrived 4 days early during the pandemic which I was super happy with. Computer was in great condition, a couple of the keys on keyboard stick slightly. The computer did not come in original box and a generic charger was given., but for the price I paid I am okay with that. The computer was super easy to update and is running Catalina now which I am super happy with.",
"Worse battery life than may 2103 MacBook Pro. First time using this the battery lasted about 3 hours. Returned it the same day. Disappointed in the refurbishment quality not the product itself.",
"Better than expected!. I just knew there would be dents or scratches since it is used, but there are literally no scratches or dents. It looks new! I love the battery life. The battery lasts so much longer than my old MacBook Pro.",
"Wouldn\u2019t even turn on. I opened the computer out of the box and after making sure it was charged it wouldn\u2019t even turn on. Incredibly disappointed. I\u2019m not sure how they could ship a computer that won\u2019t even make it past day one of turning on.",
"So far perfect for my needs. Looks like new, works perfectly, no battery issues. I've had it for about 6 weeks now and so far so good.",
"Didn\u2019t work. Didn\u2019t work, had to send back.",
"New Purchase = Battery Replacement on Day 1?. Brand New purchase with caution sign for battery to be replaced? How?",
"Floppy screen. The laptop works as expected, but the screen is lose. As a result, it can be hard to use because the screen tends to fall. I tried to get it fixed but was told by an authorized Apple repair company that there is no way to tighten it.",
"Good so far. So far everything is great but the mic is super low, I have to have headphones in or use one razor mic just to talk on voice chat otherwise no one can hear me, it know it\u2019s not the programs I\u2019m using so so far all I use is headphones so it doesn\u2019t bug me too much, just sucks a bit is all. Otherwise it\u2019s good battery life speedy, great for just going in social media, watching videos, etc.",
"Low Battery Life, Can Not Update OS, Flickers. Some kind of hardware issue is leading to the following behaviors: 1) Flickering Screen. 2) Battery Life that is below (by far) the projected or advertised 80 percent batter life. 3) Can not update the OS due to some kind of hardware issue. Assuming that the first 2 are of a direct consequence from the hardware, within the sellers domain of expertise or purview for maintaining in order.",
"Great price, perfect condition. Excellent deal--the laptop came in perfect condition. It only came with the short charger, and not the full-length cord, but I had the long cord from my previous laptop, so that wasn't a big deal.",
"Nice laptop. Really enjoy my laptop although the battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped. Also my charger died right after the 90 day warranty which I feel is poor considering my other MacBook Air laptops' chargers (through my job) that has lasted four+ years. I guess the charger was not new when I received it.",
"Is not changed. I need to return this computer no good",
"Great purchase!. Very few, hardly noticeable scratches, wouldn't even notice that it's refurbished. Had to update to newest software, which I expected, but besides that everything so far has gone off without a hitch. Wonderful purchase!",
"Could have been better.. Had some minor scratches and the screen was dirty.",
"I think it\u2019s a new notebook...... After reading reviews I was apprehensive about getting this \u201crenewed\u201d notebook. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s NOT a refurbished unit, but there is no evidence that it is. Packaging was perfect and the notebook looks factory new. It looks perfect and works perfectly.",

"Excellent computer to have!. My husband bought me this as a birthday gift. I am very pleased with it. The battery life is very long and it is a very fast computer. I love it!",
"Great laptop, so-so refurbished quality. Saving $200-$300 bucks isn't worth it when you can buy new and get the 1 year warranty. The laptop wasn't super clean, and the battery health was so-so. This is a great laptop to buy NEW.",
"this is not really refurbished, have issues. this laptop have issues, fan makes loud noise, and now its not starting up, unable to login. I will return this macbook, as this is not really refurbished, have issues - bad product",
"Reliable product that gets the job done. Arrived in a timely manner, has worked at a high level and feels new I love it.",
"Computer is in great condition. One very small ding on the car, but otherwise this computer is in great shape. I had no problem setting it up for my mother to use. Battery life is good, too. It came with a generic power cord, but haven't had an issue with it. Overall, I would recommend using a MacBook Air.",
"Lovely, solid, lightweight and fast machine. So far, the computer has worked well for my 9th-grader. It's solid and extremely lightweight and persuades to switch to Mac myself, but I hear from trusted reviewers that Microsoft is beating their newer systems in building quality. Lovely machine, this.",
"Love it!. I've been loving this computer so far! I've only had it for about a month but it came quickly and was in great shape! So far it's running really smooth!",
"It was used.. I didn't see, it was used...It has some damage (scratch)...I returned...",
"Glitching problem. Everything is great with this computer. Nothing is wrong with it. Until last week (I got this computer on August 28) it had started glitching. I\u2019m not sure what caused it but after I got home which was around 8 hours later, it was fine. This a great computer. If the glitch happens again I will definitely add it to this.",
"Save your money!. It works the battery life is about 30 minutes, if that. This really sucked for me as a teacher teaching virtually and having my laptop go dead several times through out the day in the middle of class. Save your money people!",
"fake. not a real Apple product.",
"Honest, swift and gracious about retuned item. I had to return a perfectly functional computer due to a problem on MY end. It was a swift, gracious, straightforward process, and I felt I was in good hands with an ethical seller. Noor took me clearly through all the steps. Honesty is so important when buying big ticket item ON the 'Net. I will not hesitate to buy from Tek Galaxy again. I trust them.",
"Optimizing storage space. It said I was getting a 128 Gb ram it only has 121.12 GB..what\u2019s up with that???? I feel I got ripped off. I needed it for running Logic Pro x I\u2019ve got it installed, but even before then the the notification saying not enough space.. utilize space..

"Great but renewed. I didn't realize this was renewed--no wonder it was such a great price!",
"Great purchase. Computer arrived quickly and appears lightly used, if not new. Everything working well so far.",

"Ok!. Ok!",

"Newest update slowed the laptop down.. Ran slow after updating to Mojave. Will be returning",

"Another great Mac. This is the most recent of a series of Mac ;laptops I have had and it continues the usefulness of the previous ones. The new keyboard is a HUGE step up.",
"Apple is doing everything it can to prevent me from setting up Google search.. At the moment Apple and Google are at odds, so I have stopped trying to set the new Mac for now.",
"no hay problemas hasta ahora se ve bien. una muy buena computadora gracias Jemjem",
"Product quality. Love this MacBook, so far no issues *crosses fingers*",
"Quick Delivery great condition. Gavenit as a gift very satisfied of the product",
"Compter not working.. It did not work. Returned for refund.",
"Low Space. I purchased this because my son needed my laptop. At first, I thought it was great. All I really did was search the web and visit sites. It's fast and nice for that. Once I downloaded my Silhouette Studio program, I have trouble now doing anything due to low disc space. This is pretty upsetting since this is the only program I have downloaded. I don't stream Netflix or anything like that. I didn't realize how bad it was until months later now that I need to work on projects with this software. I don't recommend using this for a cricut or silhouette.",
"Good laptop but little storage room. I purchased this computer purposely for school and web surfing. The computer has nice looking features and it hasn\u2019t given me any problems. However, I would not recommend it for anything other than web surfing, reading articles, doing research and typing up documents. This computer has very little storage room. I am unable to save all of my school related documents due to this issue. Other than that, it\u2019s great. Also, you\u2019ll have to get a mouse. Using the finger touch mouse on the lap top can get annoying.",
"simple and fast laptop!!!. this laptop is amazing!! it's already charged and ready to use. all software is already programed into it so there is no need to download anything. it already has some pre installed apps like Netflix! really happy with this laptop!!",
"Do not purchase. I bought this laptop for my daughter to use for school. She is ten. We received it and almost immediately, it stopped charging. I thought, no big deal, it's probably a defective charger. I bought a new charger. Same thing. So I contacted HP Support. They fixed the computer and sent it back to me. However, they reinstalled Windows 10, which deleted my one year free trial of Microsoft Office. I contacted them about this and they said that I would just have to download the one month free trial or purchase it for $69.99. I specifically purchased this laptop for the one year free trial and HP refuses to fix the problem that is THEIR fault. If it hadn't been for a faulty laptop in the first place, it wouldn't have needed to have Windows reinstalled. I will never again purchase an HP product. Buyer, beware!",
"Can not find good apps on App Store.. I really wanted to love this laptop but I am a bit disappointed. It\u2019s great quality for such a low price. However, all of the apps I want to download, such as Facebook I can not find on the App Store.",
"Great investment!. One of the best investments I\u2019ve made. Perfect condition. Rose Gold is flawless. Great quality!",
"Best computer on amazon you can find!!!. Honestly if you wanna computer for school with the basic needs this computer is for you. I don\u2019t get how people complain about the storage but honestly you can buy the SD card and put it in your computer and you can have more storage at the beginning I was debating Whether to buy it but I ended up buying it and it works amazing and it looks fabulous on my desk. love the color couldn\u2019t ask for more . The way they pack the computer to ship it to you is well done.I\u2019m really happy with my purchase :)",
"Amazing investment. Brand new and super quick to set up! Definitely got my money's worth too!",
"Would buy it if it were android.. Thought this unit was android like most others. Windows 10. Other than that it appears to be great unit for the price. Great color also.",
"Good deal. The computer is fine..it took awhile to be delivered though",
"Really Like This Laptop. I love this laptop. It's super durable and easy to work with. Once the laptop came it was super easy to set up and do some work on. It came fully charged, and the battery life is great. I'm in love with the color. The computer is pretty efficient which is super helpful when I have work to get done. The computer does come in S mode, as they all do, but it's super easy to switch so you can download apps outside of the app store. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a durable computer for a low price.",
"Purchased for 1st grader. My son is in 1st grade and needed a computer for homeschooling due to COVID19 school closure. He absolutely loves it.",
"Beware of this seller. Computer functions fine but speakers are defective with a squealing noise right out of the box. Seller super uncooperative about return for exchange. Several emails trying to negotiate a replacement for a non defective product with no success Told me all laptops have poor sound and I would need to use headphones.",
"Like a friendless bully. Microsoft is like the friendless bully who thinks they can shove someone in a locked room and make them be their friend. The HP Stream comes with a setting that prevents the user from downloading apps from any source other than the Microsoft store even though they have nothing useful there except the the Microsoft Office Suite apps. If you want anything from Google Play, you'll have to disable the \"S\" mode on the HP Stream and you can't go back once you do it. Microsoft warns you of all the bad things that will happen if you do, but the devices was not useful to me otherwise. In addition, they bundle a lot of bloatware in and make it very difficult for you to uninstall it. I found a way to get rid of much of it, but I am still getting low storage warning despite the low number of apps I have and the fact I store all my files in the cloud. If the price on Chromebooks is reasonable now, go with it; otherwise, this is a cheap option that essentially does the job...just with a bit of frustration.",
"GREAT. GREAT!",
"Good laptop!!. So I got this laptop initially to write minutes (I\u2019m the secretary for an organization) and since COVID hit I\u2019ve been using it to work from home (I work for a school). It\u2019s working great for everything I need it for. The battery lasts the entire school day and I\u2019m constantly on a video call!! That said it doesn\u2019t have a lot of internal space, but I didn\u2019t need much since I save everything on my flash drive and on my Google Drive. I did switch it out of S Mode because I needed Google Chrome for work. It was really simple to do, and it\u2019s been running smoothly since.",
"Very low desk space, not useful. I bought this as a budget laptop for the school year. I didn't care about processor speed or memory as it was to be used mainly by an elementary school child for school work and classes. Unfortunately once I downloaded microsoft teams on it which is the district software for online learning, it consumed almost all desk space. I have to cleanup storage every single day multiple times. I had to delete most of the pre installed apps just to gain one GB of free space so MS teams won't keep on crashing and my child missed his classes. I'm glad I borrowed a district device for my son to use that this one is a total disappointment. Please be aware of this incredibly low desk space.",
"Cute but not worth it. Purchased this a few months back due to the good reviews. The color is lovely and it\u2019s very lightweight but this laptop ran painstakingly slow from the moment I First booted it up. I\u2019ve had multiple issues that have taken a lot of googling and troubleshooting to resolve. I\u2019m a very computer literate person and work with a different model HP laptop for work every day with no issues but this is so frustrating to use that it stays in a case in a drawer untouched most of the time. I broke it out again last night hoping to play a game on it and out of nowhere the internal speakers have stopped working so I can only use it with headphones. I deeply regret wasting my money on this thing. Save up and get a better laptop",
"So far, So Good!. Just received my laptop today(I am actually typing from it now lol). I was hesitant at first because it did not have any reviews. It arrived a day early, easy set-up, Excellent condition. So far, so Good! I am glad I made the purchase. Thank You!",
"This is an awesome laptop for a child!. My daughter needed a laptop for e-learning this school-year. Last spring, she used my old HP Stream, which was a bit clunky both in weight and in ease of use. We found this newer model in a shiny pink, which thrilled her. The keyboard is big. The screen is big. We could load her school apps onto it, and she can carry it around when she needs to move from room to room. This was a great buy. I can't believe that, for the money, we got a touch screen! Score! Overall, we're very pleased with this laptop. I feel fortunate I found it before school started, and it shipped so quickly. Thumbs up from everyone in my house!",
"Its a basic unit, pretty slow but works. Arrived and was fairly easy to set up. Lot of crud you dont need on it taking up space. Has window S mode security, not real fund of it myself. I dont understand why they can just put the charge plug on the back of the computers like they used to. It never fails that they are on the wrong side. This unit has it on the RH side on laptop, not where I needed it. Time will tell.",
"Satisfied. It was shipped in one-day. The product design is sleek and chic. Very light weight. It takes a lot to set up the desktop. I assume its for privacy settings. Overall positively satisfied.",
"WAS IN NEED OF A LAPTOP. We got an HP last year in gray but since I have a brother, I had to resort to using my Windows 7 Dell and it's slow and just very old. I'm a broadcasting student and I had a semester project in which I have to shoot and edit a commercial so I needed a laptop in which I don't have to worry about having it plugged in while using it. Have had no problems using it works just as fine as the other HP we have. I prefer using chrome so of course there's no way around S mode, you have to disable it but I'm fine with that. I can go about 4 days without charging since the battery is really good and I've shut it down a few times but mostly have put it to sleep as I've been working on my project since finals are soon.",
"No Network Connection - Removing Battery. My network connection kept turning off randomly. It wasn\u2019t through my internet service but issues with the laptop itself. I had to remove the whole back of the laptop, remove the battery hold down the power button for a few seconds then place the battery back in to get it to start working again. FYI, I did this 4 times already and haven\u2019t even had this laptop for 2 whole months yet. I\u2019m looking into the issue a little more before buying a new battery (if that\u2019s the main cause of this). I am extremely disappointed and overwhelmed with this constant issue! Pro: Beautiful rose gold",
"Great computer. I Bbught this laptop for my son so he could complete his homework due to the pandemic and its perfect and the color is exactly as in the picture. I recommend this buy if you need a computer.",
"Moving slowww and I've only downloaded Chrome. This laptop has a nice sleek design, not too big or small, was easy to fit in my school backpack. Bought it to use for school, had an exam, it took 20 mins for this thing to load/not download the website I needed for a TIMED exam. Beyond pissed, but loads as slow as a turtle just trying to load any page in Microsoft Edge or Chrome. Oh yeah, you have to get everything through the Microsoft store or switch over to some other type of Microsoft, I forgot to use Chrome. Chrome eats up all the RAM on this PC.Can't wait to return this thing.",
"Good for the price. We already enjoying the laptop,very easy to use,this is for my daughter online school,is so practical and easy to work with!a plus on the color she loves her pink! I highly recommended this laptop..",
"Do Not Buy This. The computer has only 32 GB of storage. The Windows 10 operating system takes up all of the storage space. There is not enough storage for updates. It would not update to Win 10 #1909. You cannot install other programs such as Norton, Word, Adobe, etc. It is not possible to upgrade or expand the memory. Using an external drive is not possible. Many others have said that this was a design error by HP. Many work-arounds have been suggested by HP and others, but they all failed. For example, when downloading updates HP says you can select \"FIX THIS\" and chose an external drive. This does not work. I could not change it to 32 bit from 64 bit. I am very disappointed in HP.",
"Don\u2019t Do it. This product seemed good at first, but now I'm having nothing but issues with the computer. Mouse pad having issues, poor speed and performance for normal items. The laptop won't even turn on. I have small business &amp; need it for mostly shipping. Definitely not a good product. I Would not buy again. I am extremely disappointed and overwhelmed with this constant issue! Never again",
"After googling and monkeying with sound and audio, it\u2019s great for zooming. Very light weight. Keyboard responsive, keys are big and typing is surprisingly easy. 14\u201d monitor is a good size. I bought this just for zoom meetings. I wanted to keep it in S-mode and log into zoom from the website, but the video and audio were very poor, sound and video often lagged and weren\u2019t synced. I had to take it out of S-mode and also do some googling on sound and video quality in order to get it where I wanted it. After googling and monkeying with the settings, I now can say I\u2019m pleased with this laptop. It\u2019s doing what I bought it for! I\u2019m zooming successfully now!",
"Computer was crap and then I got hit with restocking fee for crap computer. Ordered for Christmas, got in timely manner. My daughter didn\u2019t get to open till January 3rd. After opening and charging computer couldn\u2019t do simple things without over heating and slowing way down. So bad that mouse pad was glitching. Price vs ability is very poor a 5yo chrome book out preformed this computer. I know different operating systems. $150 5yo chrome book vs $320 3mo HP and chrome book is winner. Also I don\u2019t recall the unit having touch screen. If it did it didn\u2019t work. I returned it after my daughter had it for 4 hrs of use. Then get hit with a restock fee. So watch out they gonna send out again .",
"For the price, it's great. For the price, I think it's a very good laptop. I had to disable S-mode, but it still works very well. I purchased mine because I needed one for college and it's been really good for doing schoolwork, watching videos, and it can play smaller games without lagging.",
"Disappointed. I am absolutely disappointed in my purchase and I regret it. It took forever for me to receive it, I am so unhappy. It\u2019s unfortunate that people don\u2019t make it right when they disappoint their customers. My computer touch screen is non existent and does not work. The battery life is less then two hours. I have used it twice and it is already freezing and being slow. I wish that I was a happy customer but I am the exact opposite.",
"Love this little gem. After gifting my older (Much heavier) 17 inch HP laptop, I am loving this little gem. Does exactly what I need and is so light and versatile. My neighbor ordered one of these after seeing mine. Works great on my kitchen breakfast bar for streaming (which makes working in the kitchen more fun).",
"Good buy w/little upgrade needed. Got the laptop w/the N4020 processor vs the N4000 version. The slight difference in speed is proven . Also get off the s version of Windows 10 and get Windows 10 home. Free upgrade available w/this laptop in Microsoft App Store. Look at youtube video for easy instructions. Buy a cheap external cd/dvd player burner then get/use old version of MS office cd to install software. I Could NOT GET the \"free 1 yr version preinstalled to work on this PC \ud83d\ude21 as advertised...only a free month of Office Family 365. Once done this PC is fast, light and 5 stars under $315 ready. Product arrived earlier then promised. \ud83d\udc4d",
"Good Product, Note One Bad Description. I may have received a newer model or something, but the version I received did not have three full sized USB A ports like depicted in the description. I did have a need for three USB ports for my application, so this was important in me choosing this particular model. Instead, my version has two full sized USB ports and one USB C port. This is a higher speed port, which is why I think the version I received is a newer version, so might be a good thing for most, but in my case, that difference meant I had to buy an additional $9 cable to convert the USB C to USB A. Also, no big deal, but the version I received has the SD card reader on the right side of the unit, not the left side of the unit like depicted in the product description. Otherwise, computer does everything I need it to do at a budget price.",
"NOT NEW. THIS IS NOT NEW. I got the computer and it\u2019s asking me to sign in as Ronald .... using the PIN number. Also the stickers on the computer are flapped back. Not new at all. Pretty pissed tbh.",
"Ehh. Screen color and clearness isn\u2019t as good as its suppose to be. Kinda disappointed, going to try and return.",
"Disappointing for HP, Easy to Set Up. Laptop color is nice, smaller than I had expected, easy to set up. However, there are several problems with this laptop. The memory is very small. Especially if you have many videos or files to load. The internet runs very slow, even when connected with WIFI. Overall, the price is right but having bought from HP before this is an inferior product.",
"TouchPad is no bueno.. I've had it a few hours now and I've already ordered a mouse to use with it. If I want to click on a link I need to find the teeny tiny sweet spot on the TouchPad that works. After four or five times, it might work. If I don't want to click on a link, breathing, blinking my left eyelid, or mental telepathy seems to open every link on the website. I only need it for writing so I'll make it work.",
"Beware: the 32 GB storage size claim is incredibly deceptive..... Bought this computer for my teenage daughter thinking it had 32GB storage. Turns out that the the computer's operating systems take up 21+GB of storage, leaving you with only 11GB of actual storage space. That's just ridiculous.",
"Not impressed. Love hp, but would not recommend windows s. Even when you disable it, you don't completely disable it. 4 gigs of ram isn't enough to do much more than check email and run basic apps, especially if you have it connected to a docking station with 2 monitors. Keyboard and mouse. Apparently you can't upgrade ram on this laptop.",
"This is not worth the money but for $260.00, I should not has expected more.. Camera is not good quality at all.......Do not waste your money.",
"Having issues with quality and performance. This product seemed good at first, but now my wife is having nothing but issues with the computer. Mouse pad having issues, poor speed and performance for normal items. Would not buy again.",
"A bit slow.... I am happy with my laptop, there are just a couple things. It's NOT touch screen like I thought it was. I upgraded for the extra memory and speed but it's still a bit slow which makes online research frustrating when you're in a hurry. But, it's still a good little laptop so far and worth the money I paid for it.",
"Buy:). Box damaged from shipping so I was nervous, but laptop is perfect. Pretty pink, light weight and voice set up. So far I\u2019m impressed:)",
"Would recommend. Well the Laptop overall is good. Fast, no scratches and works well (At least for right now. Dont know what will happen with continued use...lol). The mouse is a little sticky though, even after having turned up the sensitivity/speed but it's good still.",
"Slow. I saw other reviews talking about how slow it is and thoughts to myself that it probably their WiFi connection but, I was very wrong. I have strong WiFi and the computer was still running slow!",
"Love that this is so lightweight!. This is a great laptop! I would recommend it to anyone. My daughter uses it for school. It is very light weight and works well.",
"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!. Battery life is poor. Computer is excruciatingly slow. I had to remove apps that came on it but that did not help at all. The mouse pad is awful (most times I try to click something it just highlights it). It came in S mode which was easy to remove. Camera quality is okay if you're not used to having anything better. Mic seems to work good. Design is sleek and beautiful but doesn't negate the many issues. Overall, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. I guess you get what you pay for. I was being cheap but next time, I'll invest in something that actually works, especially when bought brand new.",
"Inexpensive option. I was looking for a laptop for my mother (70's) so we could have video calls and she wouldn't have to be tied to a desk in her \"computer room.\" This laptop works great for that reason. She will also only be using this laptop for checking email and some light surfing of the web. For $200, it is a good value.",
"Great laptop. &nbsp;Perfect size and although there isn't that much space you can get a cheap hard drive for more storage! Which is what I did, and so far if had no issues it only took me a few minutes to fix the storage issue and I never even had a pc before! I recommend for light gaming and school work just make sure you have an external hard drive!",
"Great look computer. Been pretty pleased with this labtop does everything needed for school. My only complain is a lot of the computer memory is taken up by all the installed programs I dont use and cant seem to get rid of.",
"Great, just quiet. We love this laptop, and it's rather user-friendly. One flaw that it has is that the speakers are rather low and weak. We have had to add an external speaker to help boost the volume. Otherwise, we like the computer just fine.",
"Great Laptop / Fast Shipping. I'm speechless about this product for the specs of this laptop the price was great, shipping and packaging was superb, and unboxing and setup was a breeze.. the vibrant colors on the screen and cosmetically it is without a scratch...I gave it a well deserved 5 stars...I will purchase again with ANTOnline",
"Keyboard won't work. Keyboard went out",
"Perfect. Super nice",
"Questionable. &nbsp;It is oly 5 months old and my screen is defective..The Screen just went out and I dont know why..When I try to turn it on the screen pops...This should not happen after 5 months..I just started using it regularly 2 months ago...",
"Hp laptop. I bought this laptop for school. It worked well for awhile. I've only had this almost 2 months. I couldn't download Google without it glitching all before I did the update. After the update it started glitching some more. My friend was doing something to it with the Microsoft Word program, she turned it off and wouldn't turn back on unless I plugged it in. I give it one star for delivering in a timely manner and it came in good condition. I absolutely regret this buy. Terrible investment.",
"The laptop is affordable. I like the ease in which I can touch the keys to type. I liked the price. I do have a problem in that the screen consistently magnifies. Other than that, it's performance is good. The laptop is lightweight and I'm pleased with the color, which is a deep rose. I was disappointed in that there's no compartment in which I can insert cd's, and I did think that Microsoft 365 was free for a year, and it was free for only a month. It's disappointing that I have to pay a yearly fee for it.",
"Great. Works great. Love the color",
"You may not want this one.. This is not a Windows 10 as we all know about it's a Window10S as listed. This means transferring your Windows 10 data will require you to jump through many hoops. I took mine to my specialist who is like a rocket scientist on Red Bull and it took him hours to transfer files.",
"Affordable and useful. This Laptop has all the features I need to create my poems, keep pictures organized and surf the web, and listen to music. The rose gold is adorable and its light weight to take any where.",
"Nice product. It works efficiently. However, it doesn't have much storage space. I have to save files or downloads in the One Drive/Cloud or my external hard drive.",
"Laptop. This is my 3rd HP laptop, my late husband always bought HP's, so that is really all I know. Our family motto is stick with what you know! This was the easiest laptop to set up &amp; use! I love it!",
"Disappointed. I loved this laptop, little slow but for most part worked for I needed. Now I can't use for more than 5 min without it completely freezing. Once it freezes there is nothing I can do but power it off. I am extremely disappointed \u2639\ufe0f",
"Wrong color.... Thought I was getting a blue laptop, as it was displayed, but the laptop inside the box was black. Other than that, there were no other issues with it.",
"Bad bad bad. A bad investment, I wasn't working 8 had to return it. Don't buy it.",
"Important information missing. As of right now we don't have the information we need to register the Microsoft office which was the selling point for us",
"Great HP laptop computer for school. This is a great laptop for school aged kids. It is not that expensive and does its job. The battery life is amazing!!!",
"Good Lightweight laptop for Lightweight Use. I purchased this laptop for secondary use with a hobby of mine. This unit seems to fit the bill for size, weight, and ease of use. I have not tasked it with any memory-hogging apps. I am very happy with it. I do not know why Amazon is asking me to rate the touchscreen, as this model does not come with one.",
"Awesome laptop!. Great laptop. It is the perfect size and i love the color. It works awesome and I received it WAY faster than they said. 10 days faster.",
"Perfect, beautiful colour and wonderful performance. It's an amazing little laptop and is beautiful and works wonderfully, so easy to use, I love this little laptop.",
"Shipping Issues!. It\u2019s being held in \u201ccustoms\u201d in Anchorage, AK. Why? It came from the U.S. as far as I know. It went to TX and KY with no problem, but now Anchorage is holding it. My son needs this for school so this is very frustrating.",
"Great little laptop. I am using this for my side business and other google stuff. Fast and light weight. And it is cute (just sayin). Buy it!",
"Too Modern!. Too hard to get used to where to ick or touch or not click or touch! Too \"modern\" for me! :(",
"Great buy. I love it!! I was worried that it would take awhile to get here after reading someone\u2019s comment but I actually received it a week earlier than the date it advise. Love the cuteness.. can\u2019t wait to get all setup",
"Everything I Wanted!. I was nervous about ordering a cheaper laptop from an online service. I read other reviews and got cold feet for a minute. I only need this to publish on my blog. I don\u2019t game or anything crazy that requires lots of storage. The computer started right up, was a breeze to set up and sync to my iPhone, and got down to business. I am very happy with this purchase!",
"Blue Screen of Death on Day 2 of Ownership. Good looking PC. Too bad that the blue screen of death appeared on the 2nd day of ownership. Now I get deal with HP to return it.",
"Jerk seller, faulty product. The power button on this was faulty, and I had to pay return shipping to send it back. And now, my kid doesn\u2019t have a laptop for class because everything else in this price range seems to be sold out.",
"SHORT LIFE. Had this laptop less than a month and it crashed. Had to send it back for a refund. Support team could do little to help since it would not even turn on. I purchased an HP a couple of months ago, a little more expensive, larger and not from this vendor. Not sure what the problem is with this HP Stream but it's disappointing.",
"Just no.. Camera is horrible. Looks like it was made in 2010. I ordered a blue one they sent a white one",
"Highly recommend. Product comes brand new, which I did not expect. It was easy to set up and very clean. Much worth the money! 10/10.",
"Beautiful color. Beautiful dusty rose pink, lightweight, and packaged in new and perfectly working condition!",

"Good buy!. Easy to set up and use! But it's not a touch screen.",
"arrived with middle of keyboard raised (warped). arrived with keyboard raised (warped). closing top does not shutoff screen so its always running and draining battery",
"Meh.. Battery life isn\u2019t great. Two months in, and it\u2019s having issues booting up. Not terrible for what it is, but probably would not buy again or recommend to someone.",
"The best product. I love this computer , I\u2019m a collage student and I had to purchase a new laptop and I saw this one and I bought it . The Battery life is amazing Really fast laptop A high quality screen A high quality product . I love it .",

"pretty color. i love my laptop computer",
"This product does not have a CD player.. I love that this laptop is lightweight. It is so easy to carry around the house which is how I use it. I also love the color of it, that is why I chose it. I did want a CD player but the description does not list it so it is my own fault not the manufacturer's fault.",

"It's definitely worth your money. Nice. Great quality. Would buy again. Slim. Beautiful and stylish as well..",
"Light. So far so good!",
"Decent computer. Great price. Was great for the price. As long as you realize that you are getting a computer with specs that are at the lower end and are good with that then I would say go ahead. It has worked very well as a computer for a child to do virtual schooling on.",
"Worst buy ever. The laptop keep shutting off by its self I\u2019ve been trying to reach the seller by email no response waste of money I want a refund highly disappointed.",

This laptop was not heavily used, and no questionable web sites were visited. I give it a one star for reliability and trying to resolve the issue with HP was a nightmare. I spent over an hour jumping through hoops with support and was cut off twice w/o notice. Tried to contact a real person to talk to but apparently they don't have that capability. I finally had to spend $70.00 to have it repaired locally and was w/o a computer for 4 days. Think Twice folks!",
"Do Not Buy. Great color , but wouldn\u2019t recommend to ANYONE . I haven\u2019t had this laptop 2 weeks &amp; it charges slow. The #7 key is broken , it doesn\u2019t keep a lot of storage, it doesn\u2019t let me download apps &amp; Etc. Very disappointing , you have to buy a hard drive just too save things",
"Poor Quality Display. The display on this laptop is so poor that it is not worth buying, even for the low price. The viewing angle is so narrow that the image is never quite right, and the greater the angle, the worse it gets. Even at the optimum viewing angle, the quality is mediocre. It is ridiculous for HP to sell a crippled operating system that is only good for streaming (hence the name) that is not even good for that.",

It looks like a MacBook. I only need it for web browsing, emails, general home use etc. I love the key board and how long the battery lasts. To me its a perfect laptop for what I need it for. The fact it looks so nice and looks more expensive than it is, is a bonus. It also came a lot sooner than expected, considering it was just before Christmas. I am very happy with it. Thanks!!",

"Terrible. This is not a refurbished laptop. Terrible. This is not a refurbished laptop. It is just used. Seller TECHarvard misrepresented this item. The power supply was broken and didn't work. The laptop body is damaged, dents and large scratches. I understand this is a previously owned laptop, but the product description says it will look and work like new. Not even close. I don't know who \"certified\" this refurbishment, but I have a very difficult time believing it was apple. Returning for a refund.",
"Tried to save some $. Failed.. Buyer Beware. The first sign that something wasn't right was that this product is not being sold by Apple. I took my chances...tried to save some money. On arrival everything started fine, but definitely seemed pretty slow compared to our previous MacBook Pro. First sign of real trouble came when I downloaded Microsoft Outlook for my work e-mail. The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee). In the end was fully refunded which I appreciate greatly, but would not recommend purchasing.",
"Is it stolen?. Owned and configured by \"Raleigh County School District\"",
"If you're expecting a refurbished computer like you would get directly from Apple. This computer was so beat up, and the charger was FILTHY and split in several areas showing exposed wiring. I didn't even power it up, it went immediately back in the box to return. If you're expecting a refurbished computer like you would get directly from Apple, this is NOT it.",
"Advertised product is not the same as what was received. Only worked for 1 month.. Its works okay as expected. I understand that I ordered a refurbished product but it was full of dents and scratches. Letters came off that we had to glue back. The picture that was advertised is not the same as what was delivered. Disappointed at this one. Update 9/14/17 After purchasing this in August 2, it stopped working today. I would give 0 stars if I can. Support says return period ended Sept. 1.",
"Basically it is an old version, yes. It .... Basically it is an old version, yes. It doesn't work fast. But, I have changed RAM and HDD. I mean, I upgraded hardware. Put 16 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD. Now it is as fast as brand new macbooks. I may even claim that it is faster than new ones! So if you buy, upgrade it. That is it.",
"I am SO happy! I've been reading many review before buying this .... I am SO happy! I've been reading many review before buying this refurbished MacBook Pro from this seller, and saw many bad reviews, as well as the good. Just got mine this morning, and upon recieveing it, the packaging was very protective, large strong bubble-wrap shell for the laptop itself, and for the charger within the same box. Very tiny scratches on the sides and underneath, but other then that, completely clean and flawless! Charger also is clean and working perfectly. Right now I need to update the system to masOS High Sierra, and it'll take a few hours, but after then, I will definitely update my review. But upon delivery, and immediate set up, this is a great product! Exactly as advertised!",
"Get ready for an honest, but refreshing review. I managed to get the last one that was in stock at the moment. I was super nervous because of the awful reviews, but overall my laptop is great. Listed below are some pros and cons. Pros: Barely any scratches, keyboard and screen looked brand-new, interface works very well, durable laptop, easy to update to Catalina, laptop in general appears new, lots of SPACE!! Cons: The screen won't close all the way for some reason (demonstrated in the photos), the laptop is THICK- meaning it is a pretty huge laptop, it has a CD Rom and I didn't realize that but its also a kinda pro as an artist (I can burn videos onto CDS to show on older TVS), it is an older model which made it difficult to buy a case but I found a nice one on Amazon Overall, I really do enjoy the laptop. I am a little disappointed that it is such a big laptop because it is an older model and I wish they would have disclosed the model information in the title. I also wish the fact that it had a CD Rom was disclosed. However, for my first official mac I own and for being a young college student, it works great. And for the price it was great.",
"Operating system does not work.. Turned on the computer for the first time and straight to a folder with a question mark. Meaning the operating system was bad. Never got to open iOS once. Mild scratches on the casing. I would recommend buying elsewhere.",
"Heart4Macs freakin' rocks on a \"Certified Refurbished\" used MacBook Pro. I am a very long-term Mac guy from the early '80s (I worked on beta Macintosh hardware in 1983 and am an ex-Apple employee from the '80s and '90s). I admit I was disappointed to hear (in 2018?) that Amazon \"captured\" sellers of used Macs with their \"Certified Refurbished\" program, as it seemed a heavy-handed move on Amazon's part. However, I am seriously impressed with absolutely everything about the MacBook Pro 9,2 (mid-2012 13\" 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5) I just ordered and received (in 3 days, cross-country!) from Heart4Macs. This is a clean-as-a-whistle (A or A-, only very light scratches, SUPER clean, EXCELLENT condition) laptop, especially for being 7 years young. The included battery has a reported \"Cycle Count\" of 50 (meaning it is nearly new) and instead of the promised 4 GB of RAM, this puppy arrived with 8 GB of RAM: bonus! I understand it is technically possible to install 16 GB, which I was going to purchase and install, though now I might hold off on doing so, having used a similar but older mid-2010 machine with 8 GB RAM and that seemed to suffice, even with a patched version of Mojave / 10.14. This laptop arrived (correctly) with Setup Assistant (High Sierra, 10.13.5 version) prompting me to create a new account, the nearly blank (except for the ~15 GB of boot System) 500 GB HD ready receive my data. However, I bought this particular machine because of its renowned expandability, and I'm now swapping out the shipped-with \"spinning rust\" HD for a same-form-factor / same capacity SSD. This should halve-or-better my boot time (about 60 seconds with the HD) down to maybe 25 to 30 seconds as well as create a similar speed-up with everyday computing tasks. It will install Mojave (the current Mac OS X version) and even Catalina (now in beta), so this machine is good for at least one more year of current OS and software. But with (kernel extension) patches available, I expect to get two to four more years out of this solid-as-a-rock laptop. The price was quite reasonable (I know Heart4Macs has a right to a reasonable profit margin, that's OK), and with Amazon's certification program and conscientious resellers like Heart4Macs taking the time to include a newish charger, a newish battery, a bonus on the RAM and clean-as-a-whistle condition, I'm happy as a clam at high tide with this purchase of a used laptop, one where I can eke out a few more years of value for a reasonable price. Somebody has \"thought through\" the process of refurbishing older Macs within Amazon, and in my case, it not only works, it works quite well. I'm picky, I'm knowledgable, I'm critical of people taking advantage of me if they think they can get away with a cheap trick, and none of that happened here. An overall excellent experience!",
"Hard drive not cleaned, unable to reinstall iOS. Computer was delivered with another administrator set up and much of the hard drive space not cleared. When I cleared the hard drive, I was unable to reinstall iOS and received a \"no bag entry\" error message. So unless you want to risk receiving a laptop with someone else's info on it and no ability to reinstall after cleaning, don't purchase this.",
"Great investment.. I was a little bit nervous about purchasing a used/ refurbished MacBook, especially from a third- party seller. The laptop shipped quickly, and arrived well- packaged. No cosmetic damage was noted, and the laptop appeared to be in great condition. Upon powering the laptop on, there were no dead pixels or discolored places on the screen, and all keys lit up and were responsive. The charger that came with the laptop was in good condition and worked well, and the touch pad was responsive. The only issue was that there was still a password on the laptop, preventing me from accessing it. I was able to reach the seller by telephone, and was sent instructions on how to unlock it via email, which did not work. I contacted the seller again, and was informed that this meant the laptop had not been properly reset to factory settings. The seller was extremely professional and apologetic, and assured me that he would be sending me a pre- paid return label, and that he would ship me another laptop. Fortunately, I was able to wipe the hard drive, factory reset, and reinstall the operating system relatively easily after a few quick google searches. After gaining access to the system and setting it up, I was thoroughly pleased with the product. Being an older MacBook, it is a little slow, however I feel it is a fantastic investment for the price. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something efficient, easy to use, and decently priced, as opposed to paying full retail price through Apple.",
"Poor quality for the price. This item was in very rough shape. Outside has been very scratched and damaged. Not listed as being in such used shape. Poor quality for the price.",

"Just a few scratches and a skin will cover that.. First I have a tip based on allot of the reviews I read. I always check the prime box and only select items that are fulfilled by Amazon and I have never had an issue. The Macbook Pro came with a few small scratches and a tiny dent in one of the corners but other than that it's like new, works great, and I am quickly adapting to OSX from Windows. I love it. I am going to upgrade the RAM and get an SSD but it's already running perfectly well it just takes a bit too long to boot or open some apps. I am also going to order a skin for it so the scratches and dent will be totally hidden. OSX Mojavie installed flawlessly also. The power cord I recieved with my MacBook is brand new.",
"If you\u2019re desperate, it\u2019s ok. But beware of annoying challenges. Very sad with this computer. Even though it does work and has somewhat done its part for my job, it\u2019s slow to respond to clicks and opening pages/apps/multiple web tabs. Also, it needs to be plugged in almost all the time. Within 5 minutes, the battery drained 15 minutes off a full charge, and I only had one application open.",
"Honest to goodness deal!. No scratches. Runs smooth. Great price for Macbook Pro Quality! Would buy again.",
"Wasted my money. Bought this laptop a year ago and have used it minimally for about 6 months. Several of the keys don't work, and it has some startup quirks -- ie mouse remains frozen for a minute and sometimes does not engage on selections. Contacted seller who told me to take it to a Mac repair shop. I did. When I dropped it off, they asked if I'd had trouble charging the battery, and were surprised I hadn't because the provided charger was a knock-off! After diagnostics, they said the keyboard needed to be replaced, for over $300 -- Not that much less than what I paid for the thing in the first place. Also, they said it wasn't worth making that kind of investment in a 6-year-old operating system. So -- lesson learned. The name Amazon is not a seal of approval on products from shady outside vendors.",
"Disappointment. Purchased July 2017 -screen was scratched &amp; keys sticky. Then failed for \u201cno WiFi\u201d hardware.. it\u2019s been out of commission more than working!

"OLD Laptop - Good value - Great experience. I half feel like Amazon or the seller has an obligation to make it explicitly clear that this laptop is circa 2012. They don't. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known but I'm writing this to let you know that I would have been wrong. I received a laptop that was in near new condition that included a protective plastic case. The OS is snappy and does everything I could want without the hassle of the non-magnetic USB-C power cable or the flaky keyboard of the newer models. It's heavier than I'm used to for a 13\" laptop but I'm ok with that since it has the DVD builtin. Overall this was a coup of a purchase for me. My first MAC at a much reduced price with modern software and the features that I need.",
"So Happy Until. I could not wait to get this tablet I\u2019ve always wanted a MacBook. I found one I could afford and I was so nervous because I bought it without seeing reviews and I got scared because there was about four really bad ones and I got scared. One tablet came really really fast and the condition was like Brand Spanking New. Not one scratch dent nothing immaculate. The charger like new. It\u2019s slow but I will up grade to 16 GB but working great. The reviews from You Tube says this is still one of the best laptop still and will last a long time. It\u2019s Apple after all. The only dislike I have to press down on track pad when I\u2019m using to tapping and it is heavy thicker. But I can live with it. Thank you happy with my buy. So after a couple days 2 tablet would crash. It would keep rebooting and come back up. It\u2019s been getting good reviews well built for a 2012 so I\u2019m going to try to fix it. Came in pristine condition but hardware needs rebuilding",
"Scratches, VERY slow, returning soon. My last MacBook was refurbished as well, in perfect condition and ran like new - I guess I got lucky? This one is exactly not that... runs very, very slow. Did not need a password to log into computer but to edit any settings I need the password??? Obviously an older model, which didn't bother me but the outside is pretty noticeably scratched, on top &amp; bottom. Power cord is slightly damaged as well, but works. Definitely going to return",
"Has some issues. Keeps turning off and I will .... Has some issues. Keeps turning off and I will have to take it to get it fixed at an apple store. Too late to return it.",
"Love it so much!. Apple has been known for making high quality computers and devices for decades. Their computers and phones can last for many years if you take care of them but even most accidental damage/gradual wear and tear can be repaired or refurbished by Apple trained/certified people. I've always wanted my very own MacBook Pro since that's what we have at work and I know that they're high quality and long lasting computers. The software is user friendly and even this refurbished computer can be updated to iOS Catalina (it took awhile but we got there!) These computers are all refurbished (not brand new) to be like new condition and sold by third party sellers not Amazon itself. My laptop had a few minor problems because the seller lacked honesty but thankfully the quality of the Apple product still works and shines through despite the little bit of the undisclosed screen damage, broken key, and dings/scratches on the exterior. So as a product it's really great and five stars but the 3rd party seller wasn't great and has been rated separately. Note: you can make returns during quarantine/stay at home but it takes a little longer, the price you paid isn't necessarily going to be the same when you buy another one, it might be out of stock, or shipping might be unpredictable. So instead of being without a computer I decided to work with the minor more cosmetic issues and overall I'm happy with it. I hope that your computer is even better than the one I received! :)",
"Great Apple laptop on the cheap! Expect to make upgrades.... I took a gamble with this purchase I\u2019ll admit, and first and foremost I am not an Apple computer guy, all my standards and pro software i use are on PCs. I specifically bought this on the cheap to have access to Garageband for fun, and its turned out great!!! Im used to opening up computers etc. so it was a no brainer for me to make some hardware upgrades when i tested its slow speed and performance, the HDD i swapped for an SSD drive and installed more ram, and its been peachy since. The Macbook came in a sturdy bubble wrap box within a box, and cosmetically had practically no scratches, even the bottom was pristine. Screen was clean and no OS errors, battery is fine, other than a slight dent at the top left of screen corner you barely notice it. I\u2019m guessing im one of the lucky few that didnt get a dud, Im very happy with my purchase and it only cost $100 for hardware upgrades i put in myself.",
"skip it!. First off things looked great other than the wrong charger was provided. I contacted the seller and he sent the correct charger. I purchased two computers. My son's charger sparks and doesn't work any longer. My computer, which I've used once, already won't start up. I am a long time apple user but won't be fooled again with a refurbished product. Don't wait your money or time giving this \"deal\" a try.",
"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! MINE BROKE AFTER 94 DAYS. And there is no way to reach customer service. I wanted to try to resolve this with the seller but there is no way to get in touch with their customer service. I bought this system for $675 and it worked great for 94 days and then it started making beeping noises and now won't turn on. I took out the battery and tried changing the ram but nothing worked. The computer is not usable. Don't buy from this seller!! What a waste. Note: I'm happy to update this review if the seller gets in touch with me and offers to fix the defective computer.",
"Poor quality control. Product works fine, but it had some fairly glaring cosmetic damage. It had a big chip on the back and the charger looked like someone chewed on it. It was also missing the extension to the power cord which isn't terribly bad, but it is still annoying. I chose it because I intended on putting in a solid state and upgrading the device. However, they sent a damaged item originally, so I didn't want to sink more money into the product. Fairly unhappy with the product I received. Would not recommend buying.",
"DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!. MacBook Pro was marked NEW and certified refurbished....... it arrived SCRATCHED ON TOP AND BOTTOM AND COULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE FOR LONGER THAN 2 hours! Very very very upset due to needing a laptop ASAP and trusted the process!",
"Highly recommend. I was nervous purchasing this laptop because being refurbished, the reviews, and price that this would just be a flop of a purchase... I couldn\u2019t of been more wrong! The laptop is in almost pristine condition and comes with power chord and works like a charm! I would of given this review a 5 out of 5 but (kind of my own fault) the only thing negative is I purchased this for iMovie and some other editing software programs and since it is a 2012 laptop it doesn\u2019t update to the newest versions! Kind of a bummer and there may be ways around my issue to update so I can download the apps I wanted but again and cannot stress this enough... don\u2019t hesitate it\u2019s a great computer and in almost perfect condition!",
"One Star. The product was defective. Old personal file still on the computer. Could not load new software....etc.",
"Love my refurbished Mac Book Pro and Great Price too!. A little debris on screen. Some minor scuffing to be expected on apple top. Probably laptop bag scuffing. Beautiful machine. I absolutely love my Mac Book Pro. My first one. The operating system was set to default and have had no problems with my refurbished MBP. Audio is great. Graphic resolution is great. And the price...is great too! I would recommend this company to you and my friends. Thank you for a great computer at a great price.",
"GOOD BUY. I bought this for a cousin abroad. She loves it so far and has no complaints. Personally, I'm not an Apple user, but I recognize the value for others. While I did not personally use this computer for any length of time, I did perform a user start-up and a cursory overview just to make sure it was in working order. As far as I know, there were no problems, certainly not during my interaction. I consider this a good buy!",
"Good not great, screen goes scrambled after restarting. I knew I would be getting a rebuilt computer and for most part this does the trick, but it is somewhat slow and unable to REALLY handle the only purpose I got it for, which making music with my seaboard roli. I'm not an Apple fan really. Everytime I turn computer back on from rest so far, the screen has gone scrambled (like you drop and broke it), but I restart and it's fine. If you need this for work or more uses than soley one, spend more money for a better one.",
"One Star. It arrived late. Then the screen was shattered. Along with the outside being dented and scratched.",
"Works fine with minor issues.. The good : The laptop works great. It came with o.s Sierra but you can upgrade it to the latest o.s mojave. I bought an ssd and 16gb ram separately and was able to upgrade the speed. Make sure you format the new ssd first or it won't read.I issues : After upgrading to o.s mojave, my laptop takes a long time to reboot, restart. It also makes a loud whirling noise along with the normal apple sound whenever it starts up. It seems to get very hot when you use it too long. If your copying files to usb for backup ,they will both heat up. Cosmetics : the screen looks perfect, the back is slightly scratched, keyboards and mouse pad are all working. Usb ports and charger works. I Have not tried the mini hdmi yet.",
"Product was marked up and had visible stains on it .... Product was marked up and had visible stains on it, also box was opened and didn't have tape on it",
"Defective unit.. Disappointed. The unit shuts down randomly. We received someone else's defective laptop. Returning.",
"A good buy for the price. First I put more RAM 12GB Swapped out the old HDD for a SSD. Those two upgrades have made this computer run like a brand new model and hasnt given me a problem at all. Boot time is almost instant and it runs smooth without any problems. The only con was the battery. Battery life without the charger noticeably short and the plug in adapter is a 3rd party plug. Other than that its fine. You can find RAM &amp; SSD for about $100 and watch a few YouTube videos you can easily swap them out in 20 minutes.",
"Incredible value. Mine appeared brand new other than a .... Incredible value. Mine appeared brand new other than a few millimeter long scratches on the exterior. He MacBook metal material hides them well. Screen is flawless. Open and closes tightly.",
"Description not what was delivered.. When I purchased this MacBook in December of 2019 the description said it was a 2017 model that had been refurbished. Well come to find out it is a 2012 model. So in a sense this is false advertising. But if your looking for a used cheaper apple laptop this would work for you. But during the holiday season I found this same MacBook but the 2019 model at best buy and amazon and even apples website for $699. So I could have spent $260 more and got a undented, unused, and not been lied to MacBook. So you do the math. I feel like I shot myself in the foot. But I will keep this MacBook and next holiday season I will see if the same deal is going on for the 2020 MacBook and buy a brand new one.",
"Horrible. I took this with me for my business trip. The laptop failed on me the very next day. I plugged in the power and the light on the charger would not work. I swapped it with a known working one and still nothing. I work in IT so I checked the battery, hard drive, ethernet port and nothing. The problem is the motherboard. Now I'm stuck with a payment for a laptop that is now a paperweight. If you are going to buy a laptop make sure to spend the money. Usually I would say you get what you pay for, but this laptop does not work at all and I haven't had this very long at all!",
"Great product. Great product",
"One Star. The problem was that it had a software issue the laptop never started again",
"Exactly as advertised. Other reviewers have recorded horror stories about getting a machine that was low performing, dirty, etc. In my case the laptop has a small dent on the back cover, and is otherwise clean and near new looking. The OS is up to date, and the machine performs well. Therefore an excellent deal compared to buying a new MacBook or buying a pre-owned direct from Apple. It may be that this is hit-or-miss, or perhaps the refurb source got the message and is doing a better job, I don't know.",
"The Product Description Is Not Representataive of What Was Delivered. I've bought several of 2012 MBPs to upgrade and give as gifts for friends and relatives and the one delivered was not as described. 1) Looks new?? Very scuffed up and seller tried to conceal by using cheap plastic covers that only inhibited my upgrade efforts. It failed the very definition of the Amazon renewed specifications. 2) Clean? Filthy on the insides and outsides. Unlike other resellers who make an effort to clean up accumulated inside grit.",
"Don\u2019t buy refurbished, it doesn\u2019t work. I just left the Apple store yesterday with this product and it was crashing as we tried to install simple tasks. I wish it was working properly. I want to delete my photos that were loaded by apple genius but I cannot log in to remove what Apple installed yesterday. I\u2019m very disappointed in this product overheated the first time we plugged it in and crashed it didn\u2019t work the very first time we turned it on with Apple. I won\u2019t buy a refurbished item again and don\u2019t know if the return will go well or not. Big mistake",
"Quit working after 4 months. Power button had issues from the start but we kept it and used it until it finally stopped working just after the 90 day warranty date. Contacted the seller and they wouldn't honor a replacement or a refund. Took the computer to a local repair shop. They said something had been spilled on the keyboard a long time ago (before we owned it) and it eventually fried the motherboard. Contacted the seller a second time and they again refused to refund or replace. Contacted Amazon and they graciously agreed to refund us our money. I am also thankful that Amazon stands behind their products and sales even if some of their vendors don't. I recommend buying Amazon Certified Refurbished but avoid the seller Renovera if you can.",
"Never again!. Freezes, the mouse randomly moves itself around making the laptop unusable. I\u2019ll attempt to have it repaired, but for the price, I should have bought new. Never again!",
"luv it!. picked up a \"refurb\" for a steal via a 'Mashable dot com\" blast; was some sort of crazy, one day special on Amazon so i leapt at the chance. i luv this little sucker but what i dig most is the fact that it still maintains a CD drive &amp; some other plug in receptacles that newer models have (sadly) abandoned. if you can pick one up for less than $450, as i was lucky enough to nab, you just can't go wrong w/ this little MacBook Pro (still, my all-time fav Apple product - ever)! happy hunting.",
"About 2 months after buying my Mac it started acting .... About 2 months after buying my Mac it started acting all off, it wouldn\u2019t charge, it was really slow, took forever to turn on, the keyboard wouldn\u2019t let me type and if it did it would come out in a different language. And right now it has logged me out and won\u2019t let let me log in. So disappointing",
"*****DO NOT BUY*****. I bought this as a gift and have gotten nothing but trouble from the very beginning. When product arrived and I pulled it out of the box it the laptop rattled. One of the keys were scratched off also. So when the laptop turned on it was extremely slow to respond. The first time the computer worked not great but I figured for the price it worked. The second time I used it the screen soon after digitalized the shut off. So I picked up the laptop and moved it something rattled and then the laptop digitalized then shut off again. Upon cutting the laptop back on for a third time, the overheating battery light came on and the laptop shut off again. The charger that it came with you could tell had been used and not cleaned. The laptop was used and DAMAGED UPON ARRIVAL and not cleaned. THESE ARE NOT REFURBISHED LAPTOPS. I have contacted the seller and amazon and have been fighting for a refund with no success. WARNING!!!!!! UNLESS TOU WANT AN EXPENSIVE PAPER WEIGHT DO NOT PURCHASE. Do your self a favor and purchase a real refurbished laptop from somewhere creditable like Apple themselves. If I could give negitive stars I would too bad that\u2019s not an option. 1 Star is too good for this review. There are other reviews just like mine that I have been reading. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!",
"CPU malfunction after 6 months - Don't buy. What a waste of money... this product is supposed to be \"like new\" and \"renewed\" (from 2016) and literally 6 months after purchase the CPU cores burned and could not power on. Also super slow all this time. Apple store is asking $475 + taxes to fix, which exceeds the purchasing price. After I contacted the company, NexiPC, they sent me a cold email basically telling me \"tough luck\" and that it's beyond its guarantee. They were not willing to replace it or give me discount for future products. Feels like a scam and they definitely don't care about customer satisfaction. Be careful with that company and keep all that in mind when you are dealing with them.",
"Not happy.. Returned it, because it had a scratch when I received it. Plus it was very slow. Didn't arrive as expected.",
"Great buy!. This item popped up on my phone as a 'special deal' and since I'd been wanting to get away from my Windows laptop, I ordered one. Then, I read some of the reviews and started having second thoughts, many people sharing horror stories of extensive damage to the exterior of the laptop and worse, machines that didn't work at all or only for a brief period of time. I'm happy to say that the MacBook Pro I received has performed flawlessly, no problems with software loading, my AirPods and Magic Mouse pair seamlessly, and the exterior has only minor scuffing at the corners. I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase. Thanks.",
"falling apart. the charger doesn't even work, the cord is falling apart and fraying. the computer is very slow, you can only run one program at a time or it crashes. really peeved about the charger. I hope amazon will replace it. I just bought this computer and I can't afford to replace the charger.",
"Skeptical at first. I was worried about buying it but i was fed up with my hp. Im glad i did though! I might as well have thought it was brand new with the packaging it came in! Im completely satisfied",
"You would like test out a team lear. My seller was kind and professional enough to give me my full amount back Amazon is one of smart seamless online business and great warehouse, Jeff B is my mentor I have great skills by following him, if leader will give my team members encourage guidance to empower to work efficiently to the job right on time, I want be hired in corporate that my talent gift tecnology A PEACEFUL WORLD WHERE EVERYONE EXISTS DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENT COUNTRY COLOR OR RACE&nbsp; HARMONY\u2019S SWEET MUSIC SO WHY CAN'T WE DANCE TOGETHER UNDER THE BRIGHT MAGICAL STARS SKY OUR WORLD HAS PLENTY TO SATISFY NURTURE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO LOVE THEN IT IS TO HATE RESPECTING EACH HUMANS DIGNITY TO CREATE HEAVEN IS HAPPINESS MORE POWERFUL THEN HELL WAR HURTS US DESTROYS US ALL GLOBAL KINDNESS WILL WIN WITH PROSPERITY FOR ALL &nbsp; PEACE ON EARTH IS OUR MANTRA FOR HARMONY WILL PREVAIL LOVE AND KINDNESS IS OUR NEW WEAPON THAT WILL HEAL LOVE TARO \u00a9TAROSARTS",
"Not worth it.. This came defective, the Camera would not connect, and it would state that FireVault needed to encrypt the disk. And for 24hrs it kept bouncing between an estimated 6-7 hours to complete, but never does. I needed this for school because I was going on a trip and it was a big fail. Spend your money buying a brand new one instead save yourself the trouble.",
"WORTH IT!!. I was very nervous about buying this computer for such a \u201ccheap\u201d price but I\u2019m so happy with what I received. It\u2019s really unfortunate seeing some of these really beat up computers that people are posting. I hope everyone gets the great quality computer I got. I would definitely recommend for the price!",
"Great Purchase from PrimeBuys. Mine looks and runs like new. After reading all the negative reviews I decided to buy mine from PrimeBuys for $40 more to give myself a better chance at getting a great MacBook Pro. It has a fresh install of the latest version of Sierra. I did not test the battery because mine is always plugged in for Home Sharing. It has a gigabit ethernet port. The only somewhat bad thing is that they didn't name the main hard drive ... it should have been named \"Macintosh HD\" but it is \"untitled\"",
"Misleading: Advertised as MacBooks Pro from 2017, but it is from 2012!!!. They provides materially misleading information: They advertise that this MacBooks Pro is first introduced in 2017, but when u purchased and verify its year on Apple System Preference, it says it is from 2012!!! Also, i just opened it and the Apple pro had a dvd drive with it that keeps making annoying frequent noise all the time even nothing in it. I will further test it and then update back here.",
"good to be true. I'll try harder. Sorry Amazon. Now this is my favorite part of my MacBook Pro and I'm hoping to get started with learning how to use it better, I've never been in it and I need to learn more about my phone before I go to the laptop. Yeah, so I have a little trouble signing in and out, and I'm always messing up on my phone as I try to make orders for this stuff I'm buying. I'm hoping to get better and won't be messing up my orders for this app",
"Five Stars. Perfect for my son's activities",
"Laptop is in like new condition and runs the same. This laptop is a legend. Still the best seller. Works great as is or you can upgrade to make it easily 2020 compatible. This is the last laptop that Apple produced that is upgradeable. My battery is a little jacked but that is an easy fix. It is a little hard to believe these really bad reviews about this company. My laptop and experience with this company was and is just fine. If any issues arise, I will post the results.",
"Did not work too well. The battery drained after 20 minutes use and the speaker did not work at all. No recommendation here. Could not replace the item. I had to send it back and practically beg for my money. Not recommended.",
"Goes slowly. Probably best to upgrade the SSD right away. It is a good basic computer. Still needs some updates. Bought it for myself and as a first computer for a college freshman. Make sure you configure it properly (call Apple tech...they can do it over the phone). Runs slowly so it would be worth it to upgrade to SSD immediately. Got to use the DVD player which is a huge bonus.",
"POOR EXPERIENCE. This seller needs to do more on the CPO (Certified Pre Owned) products. The battery is sub par and the keyboard needs replaced already. VERY POOR. Not even 100 days old",
"Great customer service!. I ordered this computer close to a year ago, I consistently had trouble with speed and function. I finally got fed up, thinking I bought a dud. I contacted the seller-they responded immediately and provided me free 2 day shipping to return the computer and get a replacement (also 2 day shipping). My new computer seems to be working great, I have only had it less than 2 weeks, but so far so good. I was shocked that they would replace it almost a year later- thank you! Highly recommend this seller!",
"Great computer!. Bought this for our daughter who's in college. Was a little concerned with it not being an \"official\" apple refurbished machine but she's had it for a month now and no issues at all.",
"Customers Dont Matter. I have had this for less than a month its done nothing but give me issues now it wont connect to the internet and says the network is not configured nothing helps ive done everything that I can find online from my phone to do i spent an additional 100$ for classes to help me learn the system and os. Im out over 600$ and countless hours of time no one wants to help me anywhere im ready to cancel my Amazon accounts everything from prime to my Amazon credit card.",
"Good tape, overpriced here. Got this for our son because we homeschool and he needed a better quality laptop as he is getting older and doing more online schoolwork. He's had it for a little over a month and we've had no problems with it. Some apps won't download because of the outdated operating system, but we knew that when we bought it, so that's not really a complaint. I am happy with the purchase.",
"Had an issue, but seller was great!. Updated review: The Macbook came with a bad hard drive but the seller refunded the price of a new hard drive. After changing it to a 1TB SSD it works very fast (just as fast as my expensive Windows 10 laptop with an m2 nvme drive in it). Unfortunately I kinda jumped the gun and wrote a bad review for the seller so I'll say it here: Certified Resellers is a great seller!",
"good product, good price. very bad packing. good portable, great value price ratio. Really well conserved (could clean the charger cable that was dirty muu). very little details, almost optimal. the big problem was the packing, the fdx box with the laptop loose inside. It must have been good, in this case they were very deficient.",
"Computer life Did not last long at all. I purchased this laptop in February, it stopped working completely in November and I had to get another laptop again. Such a rip off!",
"Bad Laptop. The bad reviews from all the customers is exactly right.",
"Good deal on a solid machine that can be upgraded to modern day specs!!!. Very pleased with the condition of the laptop when it arrived... Being renewed I knew it may be a gamble... There were some light scratches but I have it in a case any way so no big deal... This particular model of MacBook pro is user upgradable so I installed an SSD and more RAM.... It flies like any recent model machine... My only gripe would be that one of the ram modules was not fully seated and it appeared that I had less RAM than paid for when I went into system profiler but it was ok because I was upgrading ram anyway... When I went into the machine to upgrade the RAM I saw that in fact there were two modules just that one was not properly seated...I will buy from this seller again!!!",
"Bs. I should\u2019ve done this before I bought this stupid thing but I check the apple website and this laptop not even worth 125 and yet I paid 450 for this BS. I start to realize that I may have been ripped off cause as soon as I open the package I see wolverine scratches going up and down the top and bottom of the laptop. The screen and the mousepad clean but this thing is not worth the price. Im about to return it. Not worth it.",
"Charger broke within 4 days. While this is a refurbished product. It should be useable. Unfortunately I this is not possible when the charger is broken. After a lot research this was purchased as a gift for an adult family member who was quite excited to have it. I have another Mac in which the charger lasted for 5 years. This has made it 4 days which is totally unacceptable. The computer itself is in good condition, but very unhappy about the charger as they are $80 from apple",
"Item is not as pictured and described!. This laptop did not arrive as listed. The photo of the charger is WRONG. It is not the late-2012 model with the flat style charger. It is the early/mid-2012 version with the chunkier \u201ctoothbrush-looking\u201d style charger connector. It also does NOT have a solid state Hard Drive. It has a SATA disk hard drive. How can amazon sell these products when they list them incorrectly on their own website?!? Buyer beware!!!!",
"Exactly how it should be!. The MacBook Pro I received really looks and works like new. The battery charges properly and has only 200 cycles. An original Apple power adapter was included. Exactly how it should be for a renewed product. Seller: Easymobiledevices.",
"This piece of junk that is not Apple certified is DOA at just over the 90 day. This piece of junk that is not Apple certified is DOA at just over the 90 day warranty do not buy this not a good deal like I said it's dead at like 95 days the warranty was only 90 days now I got to go there and figure out if I can get any money back at all the hard drives gone I just got off the phone with Apple and this is not Apple certified it's Amazon certified",
"Great buy. Threw the dice with all the negative reviews I read, and glad I did. This laptop is great!!! I have been using it all day today ran updates and software checks. Great Mac for the money. Thanks",
"I received my macbook and it doesn't even work. .... I received my macbook and it doesn't even work. I can't view websites, can't update the OS system, can't download my virus scan, etc. Now I am expected to pay shipping to return my defective device? I wouldn't buy another item from this seller again!",
"Horrible experience!. This was a christmas present for my son and when we open and saw that they put tape over the top of the computer a huge slab of tape like a sheet over paper covering the whole top of the laptop with an apple sign cut out of it! Yes this really happened and when we took the tape off it had scrapes and scratches all over the top! The description said it had no scratches and blemishes which turned out to be not true! Right now I'm waiting on a refund no one has contacted me on the phone as of yet but they did approve the return with an automated message saying that it was going to charge 15% restocking fee after they sent me a damage computer! I would not recommend!",
"Five Stars. I\u2019ve enjoyed using it!",
"The MacBook Pro is excellent, runs perfectly and I am very satisfied. The MacBook Pro is excellent, runs perfectly and I am very satisfied. The laptop has a very good external image, however, in order to increase the RAM I took off the bottom tap and I could appreciate the dust and dirtiness caused by a prolongued use. I understand this computer is not new, but in my humble opinion, I recommend that such kind of products must suffer an internal cleaning, just to provide to the client an used but clean product, something that I did in 10 minutes. Thank you",

"So far runs good, but please factory reset these.. Not bad at all so far, system seems to be very responsive. I was scared to buy from these guys because of the terrible reviews but mine is holding out as I speak (might not down the line lol). If you could please send these out factory reseted that would a hell of a lot nicer than going through and doing it yourself and since it is a hassle I wouldve payed more money so you could do it damn. This is my first MacBook so I had no idea how to reset these at all so I called a support and they were very skeptical of me doing this because it appears to them that we are stealing these son of a guns, just please. FACTORY RESET",
"Buy this!!. Literally perfect condition. Bought a Kingston ssd 480gig to install in it and it went beautifully as well. Now runs 6x faster! Great purchase",
"Good solid buy.. Really nice Mac for the money. A tiny bit bulky, but what can you expect from it being built in 2012? Has every jack you could possibly want as well as a disc drive. I upgraded the RAM, and now it runs like a champ. Very impressed for what it is.",
"Don\u2019t listen to the negative reviews. I mean sure, it\u2019s refurbished. It\u2019s not going to be in mint condition and I\u2019m sure there are some people who received damaged ones. The one I received was in great condition and I would buy again. I bought from Tech4less on here and there were some minor surface scratches and some wear on the bottom. (Not brand new again it\u2019s refurbished but I was/am pleased)",
"Legacy Apple Laptops Are Still A Value For Students!. Buying this Apple over a new model wan no problem. My 16 year old was extremely happy ever since I bought this computer for her. This her main laptop and was not happy that her High School now forces all students to use a ChromeBook and is not allowed to BYOD at her HS. a",
"Untrustworthy seller.... The computer at first seemed fantastic, but then it became clear why it was being sold. It will randomly shut down, with no warning, and reboot. It will also randomly crash and go to the login screen, causing loss of data unless you've been very careful to save. Certified refurbished is not up to Apple standards and comes with some serious issues. I am making it work for the price, but I have to be super careful about saving to avoid critical loss of data. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.",
"Quality exceeding expectation. I was surprised by the quality of this refurbished laptop after the box was opened. It is just like brand new with no sign of wear and tear at all. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.",
"Not a great purchase. Unhappy. Keep freezing up. Returned. But was told the screen was broken. I returned the computer in perfect condition in the same package I received it in. Company said to let Amazon know. They said Amazon would return my money.",
"Don\u2019t BUY. Absolute junk. Images on Amazon Ads are of newer models. The Apple they sent was over 10 years old! They also sent the wrong charger! The computer had a large sticker on the front and back to hide the damage but the sticker looked like junk. Obviously they buy REALLY cheap OLD computers and selling with images of newer items. Bait and switch. Does not support basic software (word, excel, or google docs), slow and over a decade old. Actually shocked Amazon allows these to be sold by seller. Should have a clear disclaimer that the item is a \u201cclassic\u201d or non functional. Terrible terrible bad bad",
"will be upgrading, but works well.. So I will be getting more Ram and a bigger hard drive for this, but to just try it out it booted up very nicely, and connected to my internet and all that fancy stuff, so I am really happy with this for the price I paid for it.",
"Horrible choice. Please do not buy this product.. Horrible. Wouldn't refer anyone to buy refurbished products that aren't from apple itself. This laptop was gutted and didnt have apple original hardware. Didnt work well either. Please do not buy from this seller.",
"Great computer. Love Mac",
"Exactly what I expected!. Looked brand new out of the box! Gorgeous computer and runs perfect. Was properly factory reset and upgraded to the latest OS! As described, beautiful! Thank you!",
"Terrible Purchase!. First off, it\u2019s not even a macbook pro, but rather a fake one. You can tell by how thick the base of the laptop is. The charger is also nothing like macbook chargers and the ports are different as well. The charger also came in a plastic ziplock bag and was already marked up and wasn\u2019t in good condition. Also, when I received it and right as I took it out of the package it came in, the screen was shattered! Luckily, it states that there\u2019s 90 day return policy which I\u2019m hoping to get in contact with customer service to get a full refund. This is unbelievable and I do NOT recommend buying!",
"Exactly what I wanted. I prefer the old MacBooks because of their durability and the fact that they have a disc drive. Digitalizing everything is idiotic and short-sighted. This refurbished model works wonderfully and I am much happier with it than the $1200 notebook that can't do anything that I had bought prior to this.",
"Buyer beware. Buyer beware. I bought this laptop in hopes that it will be in half decent condition. However upon delivery the top was chipped inside was dirty the screen was dirty and it was horrible I don\u2019t know how anyone can present this to a customer. Mind you also for the age of it, it was pretty expensive. I wouldn\u2019t pay 30 bucks for it.",
"Strange Red Line &amp; bulging bottom. I\u2019m giving this a low rating because there were a few things wrong. The first was when I went to plug it in I found the bottom of the computer is bulging out from the top. Then when we turned it on a strange thin red line appears on the screen and won\u2019t go away. Also the bottom screws don\u2019t line up with the slots on the computer. I\u2019m really disappointed because it was a Christmas gift for my daughter.",
"Very Happy!. Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and it works great! I have no complaints it looks just as good as new. It\u2019s my first Apple computer so it takes some getting used to but so far I m very happy.. the battery holds a charge for days. The screen is like new.. I\u2019d have no problem recommending this to friends or family.",
"No one has called. Stay away do not buy from them no matter what the price .. got the laptop the next day worked will I try downloading some music from foot Box it wasn\u2019t working one song took 20 min. I\u2019ve left three messages. I\u2019ve called 5 time and every time they want you to leave a message. Amazon shout be. But I blame myself I never Read the compliant !!!",
"The company doesn\u2019t return calls, not refurbished. I called the company and got their voicemail, and they never called me back! Some of the keys on the keyboard Stick terribly, making it hard to use, the MacBook Pro typically has certain programs that should come standard, and this unit did not, and it had scratches on it. Very disappointing as it was a birthday gift for my daughter.",
"Dirty computer. Not cleaned before resale. Amazon fraud. I understand it\u2019s used and will have some wear and tear but from the description it makes it sound like it was broken down and cleaned and inspected by amazon. Which was quite the opposite. There was still crud and splatter from whoever owned it previously. A simple wipe down of the outer case left the slightly wet paper towel I used brown. The wipe down around the keyboard was even worse. How do I know there isn\u2019t semen and lube left on there. Wiped the whole thing down with germ killer. Gross. If I didn\u2019t need the computer I\u2019d send it back. Bad form, Amazon.",
"Perfect condition. I expected a used machine that is at least 5 years old to have a few scratches and maybe looking a little dull. This machine arrived polished and looking like new. It was loaded with OS10.12 which works fine with the particular software I'm using (a CADD program), an application that is performing less vigorously as the OS advances. I couldn't be happier.",
"Piece of Crap. No where did it say this computer was a 2012. I knew I was getting a used computer but it was shown as if it was new out of the box today\u2019s price would be $1200...no one is paying $1200 for 2012 technology. It\u2019s not even capable of being unlocked with an Apple Watch because it\u2019s so old. Super disappointed this was advertised as a newer computer that was used/refurbished. It is slow and old technology. It\u2019s not worth the $400 I paid for it! Honestly I wouldn\u2019t have paid $100 for this brick! DO NOT BUY!!!",
"Buy a new one, not used!. This product kept freezing up from the moment I bought it. I should have sent it back, but I kept it. After a year it quit on me. Technology like this should be bought new with all the warranties. Do not chance work projects with used technology.",
"After receiving this 2x because it was damaged both times, it has now stopped working after 4 months. Beyond mad! I ordered this as a gift for Christmas and it arrived damaged! Returned it for a replacement and it arrived with MORE damage and no charger!! Elected to keep it after it was too close to Christmas. 4 MONTHS LATER IT SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING- Almost 500 later, we now have a laptop that will not work",
"Hard drive went out within two weeks. Laptop came with scratches but I was able to see past that even though I said refurbished and I haven't even had the computer for more than 2 weeks and the hard drive went out. Took it to the Max store you said I need a new hard drive and for the amount of money I paid for the computer now plus a hard drive I would have been better off buying a brand new laptop",
"Works like new. I got this for my kid this is his first year of college I got this refurbished it looked and functions like new save some money and buy refurbished",
"GREAT LAPTOP!. I was very nervous about getting this MacBook because of the reviews I saw, but I did it anyway and I have no regrets! I just got it today and it works perfectly fine, although it does have a few small scuffs and scratches that I don\u2019t really mind and aren\u2019t noticeable, I think it\u2019s a great laptop for the price it was sold for!",
"Very Dissatisfied!!!. Very disappointed!! Whoever refurbished it left a lot of the previous persons passcodes in it and can\u2019t use half of the items. Called Apple and they said it would be very costly to get it back to working order. Very disappointed!!",
"My first ever Macbook Pro. This is my first ever Macbook and I'm quite impressed how a 7 year old laptop still runs very well. Despite some minimal scratches on the corners, I love the silver sticker they put on top and bottom to cover any blemishes on the aluminum body. I upgraded it to SSD and 16GB RAM and it runs faster than my friends 2017 macbook pro. This seller is legit and I really appreciate it.",
"Works!. It\u2019s a little more scratched than I expected- obviously not anywhere near new. But the computer works, which is what we needed! Glad to get a MacBook that fit our budget.",
"Top service. great service - seller replaced item after it stopped working within 2 weeks of purchase",
"Don\u2019t buy save your money. I bought a used MacBook Pro from this seller they even through in a free case when I got home I couldn\u2019t wait to open my package and when I turned the laptop on the screen is all busted I can not see a thing ....glass looks fine when the computers off but when on it\u2019s useless ,I guess you really do get what you pay for ...0 stars for this one !",
"First purchase and not very happy.. I was VERY disappointed when I received this. I opened it and it looked like it had been dragged along the ground. There were scratches on the back. All the ports where u plug the charger into had some sort of corrosion or built up something in em there was a dent on the frame of the screen. It was CLEARLY used. It didn't even looked refurbished. It looked used. I returned it immediately because I wasn't confident it would last more than a week before it broke down. Now I am STILL waiting for my refund.",
"My favorite. I use this every day and it works .... My favorite. I use this every day and it works like it is brand new and looked relatively new. The only downside is that it doesn't have some minor features the newer models have, for instance the camera quality is not the best. I am still thrilled with this purchase though.",
"Not worth the hassle!. Purchased this laptop Dec 2019. It\u2019s now Aug 2020 &amp; it no longer works. Took it in for a diagnostic check &amp; found that the board no longer works. Will cost more to replace the board than what I originally paid for the laptop.",
"DO NOT BUY from this seller.. This was not a good experience. The computer does not work right and is not accepting the latest update. DO NOT BUY from this seller. We will never buy an electronic on Amazon again.",
"Worth the money.. Operates as a brand new product so far. Using it to run Serato Dj Pro. Working flawlessly!!",
"Looks new and works well. Someone who has experience with Mac products will love this computer. It\u2019s small easy to travel with and operates very responsively. On the other hand if you\u2019re accustom windows, your going to have to learn computers all over again.",
"Junk. Received this Apple Mac Book Pro and would not even turn on. Customer service connected me with Apple. They advised computer ram was bad. I sent it back for a refund. Don\u2019t waste your money!",
"Highly recommend this seller. Ordered my MacBook Pro and it came earlier than expected. When I opened the fedex box the MacBook was neatly placed in the box and the MacBook also came with a free black case the worth of $50. The case was already put in by a technician. I turned it on and it was just like a brand new MacBook. Works perfectly fine with no scratches. This was a great buy for me low priced and now I can finally can make my beats. Highly recommended this seller. You\u2019ll definitely get what you want. Thanks guys",
"I am annoyed.. MacBook shuts off on its own for no apparent reason. It is very slow turning on and doing anything whatsoever (even things that don\u2019t require WiFi). Also, on the amazon renewed area it said if held a foot away damage is undectable and I have to look from across the room to not notice",
"Trouble from the get go!. Don\u2019t like the fact that you aren\u2019t able to download any new updates or apps! Horrible purchase. And can\u2019t receive a return of my money because it\u2019s passed the 30 days!!",
"PERFECTION!!! Thanks!!! :D. OUTSTANDING!!! This Mac book pro is 100% perfect! I am very very very very happy with my new laptop :) It's spotless N fast! I would definitely buy again :)",
"wrong model number. I purchased one, and it arrived not being the model advertised and not weighing 1.1 lbs. It was closer to 10 lbs. Hope I get my money back.",
"Nice Device!!. Just received the laptop today. Can't say much about battery life being we just got it. Cosmetically they are nice, minimal if any outer flaws. The laptop itself fired right up and my son got right to work doing his homework. No complaints thus far! Thank you for the quick shipping!",
"Old And Slow. Do not buy this. It\u2019s an old laptop, and it\u2019s not going to last long. Mine was already slow when I got it. You\u2019re better off paying full price for a new one that will last you ten years",
"Great value, but for experienced mac users.. I think this is just straight up used and not refurbished. Still good value, but don\u2019t get if you\u2019re expecting it to run like new. It needed to have the hard drive wiped and MacOS reinstalled. Which is so easy to do, I don\u2019t know why the seller didn\u2019t just do it. Runs great after I did that.",
"Completely outdated not able to be updated. Useless. This product was sold outdated. Unable to do any updates or upload apps. Was not compatible to any of the current software. Extremely slow.",
"Not worth it for me. I was sad to see that this computer basically won\u2019t pull up most sites. \u201cOutdated\u201d error messages abound. I don\u2019t know a lot about computers, but I thought if I bought one that was refurbished, it would at least be useable. The charger lasted one use as it fell apart into three pieces when I first unplugged it, although it was replaced promply.",
"I do like the laptop. I do like the laptop, I think that it is nice. But, there are some misstatements that need to be addressed. First, the body is nice and only has one or two tiny marks on it. If you didn't \"inspect\" it, you probably would not see it. So good job, it does look rather new and clean. Nothing was shipped damaged etc, I've seen pictures where the charger was horribly damaged and not in any condition to be used for anything other than a sorry paperweight. The computer functions rather well, I say rather because I'm not overly happy about it. When you open more than three windows, it lags soooooooo bad. With 4 G memory, mail, internet, and spreadsheet should not lag the computer so horribly. Besides the internet is not doing videos or music, it's on a static page. Also, my major issue is that it claims to have a seven-hour battery life. How about two-three hours. Literally, all I use this for at work is my scheduling software, mail and invoicing - sometimes for kicks I throw in the spreadsheet and close down something else. So, while I do like the laptop - I don't like the misleading on the battery life or the fact that more than three things open causes such a lag.",
"better condition than I even imagined. better condition than I even imagined. Certified Apple Product, and it doesn't have a ding dent or smudge on it. ***** for sure.",
"Look elsewhere...device came dirty and battery life gone... Battery came with little or no life left to it..will only work if charger is hooked up...needed updated...6hrs worth.. and was a bit dirty..during Covid19???? Expected more. Wouldnt purchase from seller again..",
"Wonderful buy !!!. I love my Mac pro laptop I just purchased (refurbished, however, it looks and acts like brand new) !! Not only was it a great deal but It was delivered expeditiously!! Great product for the price !!",
"Random, interfering \"test\" account still on machine. The machine is actually working fine, which is why I gave it a second star, however it has a \"test\" account remaining on the machine that is not allowing me to do things like turn on FileVault, since I don't have the password for this account. It also is not allowing me to sync with my iphone, when other refurbished machines in fact did. I've tried reaching out to the seller via amazon (the only way to do so) without any response.",
"Disk drive does not work - returned/refunded. Disk drive does not work: S.M.A.R.T. Status is \u201cfailing\u201d. Cannot set up the computer without a functioning drive, so returned for refund.",
"Total lemon - and DO NOT BUY ASURION WARRANTY. Laptop totally died 6 months after I bought it. \"Start up disk broken and can't be repaired\" No problem, I purchased the Asurion 4 year warranty. Phone number has been disconnected. Cannot get in touch. Bad product and worthless warranty.",
"Slow, but good for office use. It\u2019s really clean and like new, until you realize it runs as old as the year it came out. Sadly it did not hold up to Apple standards.",
"It was okay. I needed a backup laptop for work. This seemed to fit the bill. It runs suuuuuuper slow. Like dial-up slow. I only have 2 applications on it. No photos, music, or videos.",
"DON'T BUY. Would give product a Zero if I could. Worked for two startups, then would not turn on. Troubleshot every option, didn't work. Amazon customer service was helpful in returning item, but should stop selling this product.",
"Works well for high school home learning. Works well so far, and my daughter is making great use of this laptop for all her distance learning during COVID closures.",
"Not the best. After a month the screen starts to wobble. Find out tha the screws holding it were lose. Not a good quality refurbished job",
"Poor quality product.. Product broke after about 90 days. Needed to be rebuilt Not a good vendor",
"MacBook replacement. Replaced a Mac AirBook that went caput, my fault not the AirBook's. Couldn't be more pleased. Running 10.13.1 with no problems.",
"Great product thank you. Not one mark on it, could not even tell that it was a refurbished unit. Great product thank you.",
"Good value. Arrived quick, downloaded my stuff that I had on external hard drive. From my old computer that died. Works great .",
"This is a smart buy for your money.. Thus product came packaged well by seller. There were no dents scratches or anything like that. The computer looked like it was new. Software was updated and the machine runs like an Apple product should, smoothly and with out effort. Online pages loaded quickly and were easy to read. So far very happy with this supplier and i do have 90 days if anything goes wrong. I do not foresee that happening.",
"Excellent customer service.. Update: I was able to contact the seller's customer service and the sent me an RMA tag and a replacement laptop immediately. New laptop arrived and was in perfect working order. there were a couple of VERY minor scuffs but otherwise the device was in like new condition. I would definitely recommend. This Certified refurbished MacBook was a Christmas gift for my daughter and the keyboard is not working. Leaving this one star review as a placeholder pending customer services' response.",
"Excellent buy!. My daughter uses this product mainly for video streaming, gaming, social media, and Internet.",
"Gift for my brother. Let me start off by saying that was a gift for my younger brother who is starting his freshman year in college. I couldn\u2019t not wait to give it to him he is such a great kid I am so proud of him and he deserves the best and this Mac book pro really is the best for the price can\u2019t beat it JemJem you made my younger brother so happy. Thank you",
"I've been using it for a year now and it's still running beautifully.. When I got it, it appeared to be brand new. I've been using it for a year now and it's still running beautifully.",
"Excellent purchase for an older MacBook. Love my MacBook. I was hesitant at first because of the reviews but I'm glad I purchased. The package arrived promptly. My only disappointment is that it didn't come with a charger so I had to purchase one ($99 from Best Buy). I have been able to hold a charge for up to three days before needing to recharge . Overall a good deal !!!",
"Five Stars. Great products and the price is right.",
"Inoperative Laptop. Laptop turned in for 5 minutes and never turned back on. Very badly renewed, don\u2019t waste your money and time.",
"Get a newer version. Decent laptop considering how old it is. After 2 years of having it it needs to be tuned up. This may be apples doing more than anything. Buy a newer version of this laptop",
"Five Stars. Great price for what you get and so far working as advertised.",
"pretty good. When it came, I expected some dings and scratches but there were none, in fact it looked brand new. The performance was good enough at the time however I later added more RAM and swapped the hard drive out with a SSD and now it runs better than ever and faster too. I've been able to run programs like Adobe photoshop and Logic pro x with ease and no crashes after making the upgrade.",
"Four Stars. A few scratches on front cover, but otherwise works great",
"Bad business practices.. The seller claimed the product was made in 2015 but it was not true. The product was made 2012. I over paid not knowing how old the product was. They installed 2015 back cover of the laptop. A year later I found out the actual laptop was 2012. By the time I found out it was too late to return. I don't recommend the sellers because they are not legitimate or honest.",
"One Star. I actually liked the computer. But the letter \"Q\" didn't work. So I returned it.",
"and look amazing!!. While it does have a few scuffs here and there, I fully expected that being refurbished! As far as everything else, it runs smooth, and look amazing!!! Thank you so much!(:",
"Works great but had some dents. Knew we were buying a refurbished laptop but the description didn't include the dents and scratches that were on the outside. It works great. Other than the dings, no complaints.",
"Don\u2019t buy used. Buy new. Dislike. Won\u2019t charge. Dies quickly when it decides to charge. Slow. My guess it was a piss poor job of being refurbished",
"Works great!. I bought this product for my business &amp; school &amp; of course personal reasons. My daddy set it up &amp; it was an easy set up. I didn't even realize it has a CD-rom until I got it but I'm a little ol skool..so I was happy with that!",
"Very happy with my laptop. Very happy with my laptop, I did a lot of research and am pleased with this product. There is a small scratch on the top case but it is refurbished and doesn't effect the product at all.",
"Arrived in terrible condition. The computer itself works just fine. But it arrives so scratched and so dinged up and so ugly. It was awful and had this black case on it that what I finally got that off to put a color on it that I like I was shocked at the condition this computer was in. It literally works but that's it. I am very very not happy.",
"Item doesnot worl. Item does not work.bad buy",
"I was wowed for used. Almost as clean as new and worked perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised",
"Good. So far so good. Some buttons don\u2019t register you have to hit it a few times. The battery doesn\u2019t last a whole day. We even let it die completely and unplugged it as soon as it was done and still doesn\u2019t last.",
"Great Buy. My first Apple Computer, Its great had it for three Months got it in july looks like new and works like new no issues with it since I got it. It has Mojave OS installed on it I like the usb and cd rom build in it, get to burn my music and play my DVD movies on it. a plus I had to sigh for it when it was delivered. I'm glad it bought this one than a new one save lots of money.",
"Be careful. If you are trying to deal with music or edit videos don't buy this laptop buy something much newer because it seems like nothing is compatible for this laptop due to it's age",
"Perfect laptop. Exactly what it said. Perfect apple product!!! Will buy from seller in future again.",
"Livid. I was expecting a newer model MacBook and instead received a 2011 MacBook Pro with files missing from the computer to where I couldn\u2019t even start it up. Although it was returned I don\u2019t recommend this to any one",
"Hardrive broke after 3 1/2 month. Headline says it all",
"Computer works great, the only two issues I had was. Computer works great, the only two issues I had was. 1) the charger cable did not work so I had to buy a new one. 2) it had more scratches and dents than describe but that's just me being picky. For the price this is a great find!",
"Upgrade the memory. Great computer for the price!! I run Mojave on it with the max ram on it and it's great!",
"Pain in the.....!. Battery quit working a few months in . I am getting sent in circles to have it replaced by the extended warranty company. Everyone is pointing fingers at the each other on who is to cover it. Seller will not contact me back. The warranty company said call Apple.....they laughed at it. Said the problem is the seller.",
"Good laptop for my intended purposes. Good laptop for my intended purposes, needed to upgrade to 8 GB RAM for more seamless operation. Overall I'm satisfied.",
"Plenty of GB space for years of use.. Beat apple I ever bought. Out of the box ready to be used.",

"The best reseller on amazon for macbook pros. When i got the laptop i was scared at first.... on opening the product everything greatttt , clean and neat, i even got a free case with the product and i didnt even know i was getting it. I would order from this seller any day in my life they are the best. The laptops functions perfectly with no problems.",
"Quality. This product was not what I expected.. it doesn\u2019t turn on.. it just beeps... was never charged.. the casing on the laptop was changed.. it\u2019s just horrible.. you would think you would have tested it before sending it out.. just terrible..",
"Very disappointed!!!!. I bought this macbook for my daughter to used for her school work online scene the school been locked down. I spend alot on this. But it's say 2012 but what I got is 2010 not 2012. And It's not only that the outside is scratched and dirty.. for that much of money I think it's should have been little cheaper..",
"Powert cord didn't work. The computer works great, however, it came with a dead power cable. It cost $80 to replace....",
"Product arrived slightly damaged.. Screen came off first time opening the laptop. A wire was disconnected behind the screen. Hopefully no other issues. It did come with a case so that was nice.",
"One Star. Was dirty with dents all on it. Horrible I was surprised @Amazon",
"Has many problems. Not a refurbished apple MacBook Pro Is a Pre 2012 Dents and scratches and food substance splattered on back of laptop. Battery Charger does not work. Only has 15% charge on arrival. Missing parts. It will Cost you out of pocket to send item back.",
"Make sure you know what type of keyboard layout you\u2019re getting. Please remember to zoom in on the product from all angles. I failed to do this and I received a French keyboard layout. I ended up just ordering a new upper case with US keyboard integrated and replaced it myself for less than 40 bucks. Otherwise great product I love the backlit keyboard. I still have my old leg 2009 white Apple MacBook which maxes out on High Sierra but with this one I can upgrade to the latest OS.",
"Five star seller. Exceeds expectations although charging cable arrived DOA it was replaced immediately by seller. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would buy from this seller again",
"Have actual images of computer that will be purchased and not generic picture. The product is not as described. It would have been nice to see the actual computer that I purchased before hand. I would have chose a different one all together. The computer has several scratches on the top. Not something that I particular like. The stock image is very misleading.The function is sub par not refurbished. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR FROM THE SELLER",

This Mac book is terrible you can\u2019t update the software as well as the back was coming up I put in a replacement ASAP I just received it today I\u2019m not happy at all main reason why I never bought refurbished products.

"Good starter Mac. Great starter Mac. I upgraded this to 16 gigs of ram and swapped out the 500 gig hard drive 500ssd. Works great no problems and was cosmetically good looking. My only issue is the the battery drains kind of fast so I'm guessing I will have to replace that soon but other then that works great.",
"Worth the price. Kinda loud when turning in and the disc reader is also VERY LOUD! Not a bad purchase overall got my monies worth. Also has a missing screw and missing eject button for the disc",
"Don\u2019t buy from these people. Computer stopped working after 3rd time turning it on not worth the money",

"only 4 stars cause i read bad reviews about the company selling stuff that breaks in .... only 4 stars cause i read bad reviews about the company selling stuff that breaks in a few months but so far so good i don't see those reviews being applicable in this case , in my opinion it might as well have been brand new, works brilliantly",

"Get what you pay for.. It is a refurbished laptop so expect some minor cosmetic dings or scratches. The laptop set up fine an was downloaded with the most recent OS which was nice. Charges up and holds full charge for around 5 hours, it is from 2012 so not suprised. If you want an affordable MacBook Pro that works fine get one.",
"Works but definitely looks used.. First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box were the scratches on the lid and upon turning it over saw 2 screws loose, protruding from their holes. I installed os high sienna and it seems to be working fine, it just appears beat up cosmetically, not like new.",
"Don\u2019t sacrifice cost for quality.. This Mac was purchased as an affordable replacement, but has been slow since and glitchy since it arrived. It finally crashed after only a year of owning it and been getting slower and slower. I will not be buying refurbished products from here again.",

"It\u2019s good. It works great. I read a lot of bad reviews and was skeptical. I put it through it\u2019s paces and it works as it should and is in great condition for a 5/6 year old computer.",
"Works amazing. I was so nervous to make such a big purchase off amazon, but I realized it was totally worth it! I needed a laptop for school and this one runs perfectly!",

"Received and Returned the same day. I tried it and was disappointed. You get what you pay for is the cliche thing to say but my experience is I got the computer one day and returned it the same day. iTunes wouldn\u2019t load and the App Store didn\u2019t work and Gmail didn\u2019t work, but safari worked. I spent the extra $300 on a quality Apple computer and I felt a lot better.",
"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!. This was absolutely horrible. Got the item it had someone\u2019s named scratched into it looks like with a key and 6 of the keyboard keys didn\u2019t even work.

"Overpriced door stop.. I owned this product for exactly four days. The battery consistently died within mere minutes of having a full charge. Finally, the thing just turned off, and never turned back on again... AFTER I put all my files and information on it. Also, it looks like someone ran over it with a tractor.",
"Reputable company and I would purchase from them again. I purchased an apple laptop. I was just a few days short of the 3 month warranty period and had an issue and they gave me a full refund. I would definitely purchase another from them and plan to. I really liked the mac book! And miss it already.",

"Works well. Is the right size, not to heavy.",
"Great value for the price!. Absolutely satisfied with my purchase! Came 1 day early, packaged well and was charged. Very minimal ware, but I mean it\u2019s 8 years old, what do you expect? Screen is perfect, battery only had 1 cell count. I bought the 8GB ram model and it came with 16 GB and the OS was fully updated!!",
"Don\u2019t buy!. Was never able to open, many attempts for help with useless response. Lost time and money",
"Five Stars. Excellent product, it looks like new, this is the best acquisition made this year",
"You get what you pay for?. It's functional and reasonably worth the price, but still kinda buggy. I've had it less than six months and I'm already having problems with the charging port.",

When contacted customer service I was told \u201chappy to help but can\u2019t since it\u2019s past 90 days\u201d it\u2019s practically new &amp; now I\u2019m stuck with a POS computer.

"works great. I dislike that arrived with some dents and i believed could be better wrapped to avoid future dents on delivery..my wife loved it and works great at least for now",
"As expected. The computer is a little slow and I had to replace the charging cord but for the value it\u2019s good.",
"Excellent. It looks new, has no scratches or anything, and very little wear. I think it's a good purchase",
"Great deal.. Excellent condition, works flawlessly. Plan to purchase another one to support a church project.",
"Do Not Buy One Of These Laptops!. Save your money and buy a new one. The one we bought worked for 2 hours then just stopped. Do not buy one of these computers, was a bit scratched on the bottom, no big deal, but stopped working on Christmas right after it came out of the box. JUNK.",
"Good Buy. I absolutely love my computer. I had to update and reset it when I got I to update to the newest IOS but no issues since I\u2019ve received it! It had some dents but is it a used computer plus they sent it with a computer cover. Good buy!",
"Not worth it. Luckily I got my refund, but when I got the laptop I was upset to see it was a 2012. Also when picking up heard something very loose in the casing of it. I would look somewhere else.",
"Great laptop. I have never owned a Mac before , and this is a great computer. Very easy to use and intuitive.",
"Fairly good, but still has an issue. Besides the actual screen under the glass being a little broken and the pixels being messed up as a result, it works great. I\u2019m rating four stars because with a little pressure in the right spot it temporarily fixes the issue",
"Apple products are great. Great computer,easy to use and small",
"I was pleasantly surprised works like a charm looked really good to. I was pleasantly surprised works like a charm looked really good to",
"Why did i even buy this, i have a phone. This product was terrible, i bought it two years ago and to this day it still can\u2019t even update chrome, update its own software, and as well the battery life runs quicker than usian bolt. Would not recommend for the price that it\u2019s asking.",

"Works great. Computer came in like new condition. Works perfectly.",
"Good buy!. A few Little scratches on the outside, but I\u2019m using for music use so it function very well and I haven\u2019t had any issues with it thus far!",
"Battery needed replacement. The battery life was much less than the description that accompanied this product.",
"Year Mac was made should be part of description. My complaint is mostly with the reseller. I'm new to a Mac so I realize I have a learning curve on how to use this, but my laptop seems to be extremely slow. I went to an Apple Store today to have them take a look. First off, they were surprised that the year of my refurbished Mac was not in the description. Mine is a 2012 and if it was 2011 or later, it would be considered \"vintage\" and they would no longer support it. As it is, I only have about 5 years on this and Apple will no longer support this model. I needed a software update so they wiped it clean and put the latest \"non-beta\" version but I'm having trouble now reinstalling my programs. I am so frustrated. I'm past the return or support date from the reseller. I don't think I would have even purchased this if I had known that it was already 5 years old.",
"I was expecting something better. Batterie's life is not the best and some cosmetic stains in the screen, I know, it's a used computer",
"Ridiculous. After a year, it\u2019s not turning on and it\u2019s difficult to get in contact with the seller",
"Happy with purchase!. I ordered this for my granddaughter as a Christmas present. She loves mine so I thought I would get her one, especially with online learning being so prominent.",
"Buyer Beware. The laptop is not what was expected at all. It is a very old (maybe 2011) outmoded laptop and didn\u2019t even include the charger cord (and the laptop model is so old that it requires a very different charger than even the 2015 models).",
"Damage garbage. This should have been a birthday gift for my daughter but it turned out to be a bad surprise. This laptop came with scratches and a lot of dents. After seeing all of this the it made me change my mind so Iam retuning it right back.",
"No customer service!. Sent numerous emails and they don\u2019t respond!!! Mine wasn\u2019t as beat up. Just scratches and worked fine until after the second charge. It doesn\u2019t want to charge anymore!! Don\u2019t buy this please. Save yourself the money and the hassle",
"Wish I never bought. The slowest thing I\u2019ve ever had! It won\u2019t pull up apps without a 10 minute wait and then kicks you out. Total waste of my money.",
"Very slow. This was to be a replacement for my stolen MacBook Pro. It will do until I can get something else. It is very slow and does not want to update. The trackpad also does not work well. Had to go buy a mouse instead.",
"Great loptop. This loptop is great so far. It\u2019s easy to use. I am so happy I bought it.",
"Very nice love this macbook. Love it so much",
"Better than I expected. Received it earlier than expected and it was in very good condition, looks pretty much new. It is a bit slow once you start it but will be upgrading it so that's not a problem. All in all very happy with my purchase as of now.",

"I recommend it. It is great I love it you should totally buy this but the only thing that is bad is that it is kinda slow but not really everything else is amazing and especially the battery life it last for me for like 4 days",
"Customer service isn't very good. Be aware that this company won't try to help with a computer that isn't working and wasn't working correctly from the first time we turned it on. It was a Christmas gift an wasn't used in the first 90 days.",
"Decent and easy to use.. We bought two and this one was way better than the other. If functions and does the things we need it to do for my husbands schooling.",
"Product met my expectations.. Product met my expectations. I am thinking about getting a second one.",

"Hard drive died after 2 months. I liked this computer. It wasn\u2019t fast, but I was able to do what I needed to do at a good price. Sadly, the hard drive died on it within 2 months of owning it.",

"The price. I like the price but it\u2019s a little small",

"Great value. Runs like a champ and is much cheaper that buying a new one.",

"Excellent replacement for my fried MacBook!. How I came to buy this computer: A few weeks ago, I spilled water next to my Macbook Pro and fried the logic board. The repair cost quoted to me was so unacceptably high that I looked for a replacement instead. This laptop is essentially a clone of the one I ruined, except it's in perfect condition. I'm on a budget; what more could I ask for, honestly? The specs are the same (my old one was purchased March 2015), everything's pretty much the same, but cleaned up. I'm very happy with my purchase, it's just the right thing. Nota bene: it's not a bad idea to have a backup power cord. Not the extension, just the regular cord. They're about $23 and they tend to break down easily, that's a big downside of Macbooks.",

A couple little scratches I could see at 12 inches away (which is the standard they use for \"like New Condition\". I expected it to be pretty flawless, but for the price, I can live with the small scratch and my daughter keeps a cover on it at college anyway. I did immediately upgrade the RAM, and the inside was like new.... no dust. I'd give it 5 stars, but there were a couple scratches, mostly on the bottom. I checked the cycle count on the battery, and it was a respectable 72, so it's not been used much. Overall, buy it",

We like MacBook products and have several. Everything in my order was I great shape and is as stated and promptly shipped.",
"Would not have been able to tell the difference from a brand new one.. I spilled a glass of red wine on my MacBook Pro MC374LL/A from 2010. I was in the process of buying my first home at the time, so a brand new replacement just wasn't in the budget. I decided to put my faith in a refurbished MD101LL/A and I am very pleased with how it all worked out. First, it arrived in the appropriate packaging with all of the relevant accessories. Second, the screen, keyboard and frame were immaculate. No noteworthy scratches, dings or scuffs. Battery life and processing speed were solid from the start up. Anything is an improvement when your last laptop was 5+ years old, but I can honestly say I would not have been able to tell that this was a refurbished unit if it was not advertised as such. I've had it for a few weeks now and couldn't be happier with the decision. Saved myself a few hundred bucks and it exceeded my expectations right out of the box.",

"BUYER BEWARE! This Seller Deletes or Reports Reviews They Find Displeasing. This item arrived looking cosmetically displeasing as it was dinged, scuffed and severely dented in upper right screen side of the computer. This is NOT a refurbished item as the business definition of \"refurbished\" states. This is, at best, a used, severely damaged computer. Upon powering up this computer for the first time, it took a little over two hours, a tech support call to Apple, a \"first aide\" run, and a factory reset. It worked at a nearly excruciating speed for a few days. I powered it down, in hopes that it would start back up \"refreshed\". Two days later, I tried to turn it on. It took over three hours of \"turning on\" when I finally decided to make another call to Apple. This is what we did*. (*Please see attached photos, as they are of my notes regarding the most recent phone call.) I have made more than a couple attempts to call the seller; it rings once, if at all, and promptly goes to voicemail. So all in all I have this \"brand new\", refurbished computer that arrived broken, with seemingly no solution available to resolve the issue.",
"Really good purchase!. I was extremely hesitant to buy this laptop because I read a lot of bad reviews and horror stories about people who purchased refurbished. Well, the laptop arrived today and it was even earlier then expected and when I opened it I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the power cord to the laptop looks brand new. In fact, the only way you know it's probably not new is because it didn't arrive in an Apple original box; it arrived wrapped (neat and tight) in a white box within an amazon box. It has actual two USB 3 ports, one thunderbolt port, sd card reader, HDMI port, DVD drive. It also has the MagSafe charger, illuminated apple logo, etc. The force trackpad is nice to use, the keys feel fantastic to type on. Screen is flawless. This computer came with macOS Sierra operating system. It runs fairly fast. Apps open almost instantly and the wifi performance is great. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this laptop!!!! Overall this was a wonderful deal. I\u2019m so so happy with this purchase. Thank you Amazon Seller: PrimeBuys",
"wow I'm excited. my son recommended this Mac Pro because he has one. his work fine. its refurbished also. He ordered me one. He was wondering why the price was so cheap. We didn't know if we got a deal or junk. I went back and read the reviews and they were very discouraging. I said when the Mac Pro come in I was returning it immediately. Boy was I wrong. Im very very pleased. Its looks brand New except for a couple of dents barely noticeable at the bottom of the lab top. The keyboard looks brand New. The keys type fine. The lab Top is up to great speed and down loads fast. I love it. I'm so glad that after all of the bad reviews I've read, I'm glad I went with my move and gave it a chance. I'm loving my Mac Pro. It's looks brand new and it works great. Excellent Buy. EveryOne's experience is different. Mines was a great move. My power card look brand new. My Mac Pro was packed tight and labeled FRAGLE handle with care. I'm one happy customer.",

"Falsely advertised.. This is a mid 2012 model, not from 2015 as the ad suggests.",
"Horrible Quality - I should have returned it. The Mac was a gift for my daughter, she advised me right after the 30 day return period passed that something was wrong. that the PC is running very slowly and sometimes locks up completely. I wish I had known in time to return it. She has friends with the same type of PC so knows what speed she should be able to expect.",

"Found out more about myself from these reviews so.... I bought one of these from someone who was selling both on eBay and Amazon &amp; someone I know bought one of these from the same seller on Amazon &amp; my review of it is that it's far more laptop than I deserve. USB 3.0, FireWire 800, &amp; Thunderbolt 1.0 make for an awesome combo for usage to try and do anything with it. I mean, another reviewer &amp; I shared the same laptop &amp; we both loved it until it was about to overheat &amp; die under my stewardship &amp; got red wine spilled into it under his. We now have the MD101LL/A model the both of us and it was the best thing @ all imaginable. Yes, the MacBook Pro broke eBay's back for my father. But I got a replacement for the MacBook Pro I gave up &amp; so did he. There are some times where that's all that matters, that justice is done in the end.",

"Works Great. I was very skeptical about buying this product after reading the reviews. I got mine in the mail today. When I took it out of the box, I noticed a couple of scuff marks on the bottom. I opened it up and turned it on. It powered right on. I hooked it to my wifi and set it all up. I am using it now to wright this review on amazon. It runs smoothly and efficiently. The screen has no marks or odd spots. The charger and keyboard both work fine. You would not know that it wasn't a brand knew item besides the scuffs on the bottom. I am very happy with this product. I would purchase again.",
"Expected product. There was no issue in ordering. It's typical apple product. I have great experience with apple products",
"Don't buy it, very bad laptop. Very bad quality product. Looking like more than 10yr old and battery backup is less than 15 min. If Amazon will not refund my money then I will go for legal action against Amazon.",
"Not happy. This laptop did not come with the right charger cord. Once the battery was dead we could no longer use it. We are not happy!!",
"been sent back several times. A Buying a reconditioned computer is risky, but we thought it was worth the gamble. Wrong!! Have had to send it back twice as it has stopped working and all my stuff was wiped as I hadn't backed it up (we had only had it for 2 months at the time). It is currently working after all sorts of problems with DPD delivering it and then losing it, but I am not holding my breath and hoping the 6 month warrantee doesn't run out before it stops working again.",
"Incredulously slow!. I had this exact same model of laptop previously and it was absolutely perfect, worked like a dime, but unfortunately, it got lost. I ordered this refurbished product to replace it, and I was severely disappointed. While the laptop arrived looking perfect apart from relatively insignificant dings, the laptop is incredibly slow. So much so that it is impossible for me to work daily with it, despite having all the patience in the world. It is incapable of opening more than 4 windows without the laptop crashing, and no more than 3 tabs on Safari/Google Chrome. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase and in the process of returning it, nor would not recommend it at all. Don't buy this laptop.",
"Pristine Condition for its Age. I am very impressed.. Ordered on 12 May, here by 14th, delivered by courier and superbly packaged in a protective airbag and was provided with what seems to be a new MagSafe. It booted from the outset, no issues at all. I have run through various actions and services and all seem to be fully functional. I was particularly impressed with the cosmetic quality: I can't find any dents or scratches, the screen is clear with no obvious dead pixels and the keyboard action is solid so you feel you are typing on a quality mechanical keyboard and not a membrane one. Very impressed for an 8-year-old laptop, CRS - the supplier - provide a detailed checklist carried out before shipping and offer a 12-month warranty, backed by Amazon. So far, I am most impressed and have no hesitation in recommending the supplier and the quality of their service. You will not be disappointed.",
"Massive Headache. Seemed like a good deal for what you\u2019re getting. But I highly recommend spending more money and getting a product that actually works. For 3 or 4 weeks the laptop worked perfectly but then it started getting slower and slower. It\u2019s gotten to the point it\u2019s barely usable. Today it took 45 minutes to open up PowerPoint. Huge inconvenience, avoid if possible.",
"Had a day and broke. I've had it a day and already broken, the seller was great as the charger was forgotten to be put in the box, very quick response and sent out for next day delivery, but since charging laptop not turned on again, in contact with seller for this to be fixed again very quick response and very good to looking after you for them 5*",
"Slightly disappointing. The battery empties quickly. Deep scratch near to the keypad.",
"Great condition laptop.. Have been using it for a few weeks now. The laptop came in good condition which I wasn\u2019t expecting. Works great for the year of production it is. So far had no complications with it. Would highly recommended buying it if you are unsure wether to go with an refurbished product.",
"Major signs of usage!. Ad says it is like brand new and doesn\u2019t have much signs of usage. Mine came with a dent and many deep scratches looks horrible. The charger looks so beat up and scratched and came with a broken clip . Also the light on the charger works only sometimes. Better to buy the other cheaper ones. Not worth the price I would not recommend!!",
"Buy a new one if you can afford it. Poor battery life returned for better battery and got a worse one than originally had. Also keyboard was full of crumbs stuck underneath keys. Sent back for refund.",
"Buy you won't be disappointed. Would be faster to boot up with a ssd but would need to be 500 GB. Excellent condition, only superficial dings where underneath on the bottom of the mac and a tiny one on 1 corner, otherwise I'm very pleased with my purchase, takes up to 60 seconds to boot up on its Hdd, and up to now is faultless in computing opening pages as requested. Would buy again.",
"Not Happy. I was very unhappy with this product. Very poor battery life. Maeve B",
"Excellent condition. Apple macbook arrived looking like a new macbook not a refurbished one.. Only way to tell was a little wear on the power button, unit was fully charged and came complete with charger. Wouldn't hesitate to use this company again.",
"Software Upgrade. I bought his product for my son and he reported that the FaceTime and iMESSAGE is not registering. i am wondering if it has to do with the software so i upgraded the IOS but it still not allowing him to register FaceTime and iMessage.",
"How my laptop will be fixed?. I brought a MacBook pro in May. It\u2019s now faulty as screen displays a question mark constantly and just recently, does not even turn on now. Just emailed you, so waiting to see how you are going to deal with this for me? Thankyou",
"Great value, exactly what I expected.. Great item for a used laptop, impressed with the battery life, condition functionality etc. It has a few small scratches but is visually in great condition and I know badly these Apple products scratch. Definitely worth the money.",
"great tool. nothing to dislike",
"Great value. Into 2019 and working like a dream.",
"Don\u2019t buy. There are obvious marks that it has been used before(see the photos), It won\u2019t find any of the networks I have to go to and that\u2019s pretty annoying, I have to make some kind of networks search for it to let me see the possibilities. Plus the battery is pretty old, I used coconut battery(the application) to see how bad it was, and it was okay(71%) the optimal is 85-90%. Besides all of that it\u2019s good for a 2012 version Update of 2ish weeks - my screen is turning yellow and getting back to normal from time to time for no apparent reason -the Wi-Fi network wont work at all, I went to see a specialist he said that the person who made the repairs must have disconnected the plug inside the computer The more it goes, the more disappointed I am, I won\u2019t recommend this to anyone, it wasn\u2019t worth it",
"Expected better.. Heats up very quickly, battery life goes very quickly, very slow, sometimes the mousepad doesn\u2019t work properly and smells funny when it gets hot. Apart from that it\u2019s ok.",
"Good value for money. Looks good, works ok, arrived within 2 days. Early Xmas present",
"Can't get any better. For a referb it's perfect",
"Great bargain. Received it in great conditions. Battery life could be better but for the price I think it\u2019s an overall good deal.",
"Reliability.. Very good quality body and keys. Smooth operation.",
"Fast delivery. Lovely product. Really good condition and an extra 6 months warranty",
"Good. Play football",
"Excellent value. Excellent value for money",
"Condition is super great for a such six-year old machine! (I am from 2018). I was very impressed by the quality, and functionality. Only 2 small scratches on the lid, but they ain't really seen. Suggest you buying it before an update is finished on May 2019",
"Decent. I was honestly worried because of the negative reviews. It\u2019s been a few hours so far and I think the Macbook runs fine (just 4gb of RAM isnt enough so i\u2019m looking to swap that). I was also worried because it said \u201c1lithium polymer battery required\u201d and not \u201cincluded\u201d so i thought i was getting a Macbook with no battery! turns out it has a battery and its looks in really good condition. Just RAM space ran out even before I installed anything. So will add more ram",
"Value for money. Ive seen negative comment about this Mac but just so you know it works really fine , I am using it on High Sierra which works great and is as fast as the new Macbook but if u gonna try it on Catalina it might slow a bit since its am old machine , but best suits with High sierra and runs awesome battery life is around 7 hours and perfect condition no scratch .",
"Not perfect, but good value.. Product was as described. It was a 2012. Comes with old operating system but can upgrade operating systems by at least a few years. Dont think the 2012 hardware would support the newest operating systems. The trackpad is slightly defective but doesn't cause any real problems. Some people have major issues with refurbished laptops, but its been 2 months, and its doing fine. I use my laptop for basic stuff, nothing fancy. So, theres a risk involved, but new macbook pros are almost $2000, so getting this for $700 was reasonable. I like Macs, because you turn them on and they actually work.",
"Cigarette Smells. No problems with the parts or pieces. My only complaint is that the thing reeks of cigarettes.",
"So far so good. Does the Job have had no issues as of yet.",
"Great deal. Looks great. It only had a scuff on the top from where a case was previously used. It works as expected and was easy to set up. Great deal for something that still retails for a little over a grand.",
"Terrible Buy. Received my laptop with many issues... Glitches out constantly have to restart it. Dvd drive doesn't work, can't access app store / iCloud/ or download any apps or updates... built in mouse pad doesn't work. Worst purchase I have ever made online. DO NOT BUY",
"Not refurbished. Extremely slow right from the moment i first opened it and tried logging in. Didnt even make it through the initial customizing steps because it would freeze for five minutes at a time when trying to connect with my apple ID. Despite the negative reviews I bought this product expecting a \"refurbished\" computer, there is nothing refurbished about this.",
"Le produit est arriv\u00e9 bien emball\u00e9 et m\u00eame avant la date. Pour un usage personnel",
"Buying the unknown. This is a good buy, but the optical drive does not work. Obviously these refurbished computers are not thoroughly tested before shipment. Someone is slacking.",
"Defective. Very happy with the overall performance of the computer, however the CD drive does not work, which having to clear all personal data and return it is inconvenient and frustrating. I don\u2019t understand how that could have been missed when the product was tested.",
"Locked out from network. The macbook was used prior as a router and had a encrypted block in all networks. Therefore I was unable to connect to the internet. I had to take it to be fixed and pay the bill which I feel It should have came ready to use. Not happy as it is for university student who was in dire need of a macbook then and had to wait over a week.",
"NO COMPRAR, no hay servicio posventa. No compr\u00e9is. Lo compr\u00e9 hace un a\u00f1o y no funciona bien. No me dan soluci\u00f3n. Ped\u00ed la devoluci\u00f3n pero dijeron que ya no se pod\u00eda. Una a\u00f1ito justo.",
"Great Purchase. The device came and it did have 1 small scratch on it, but it works perfectly. Very good value for the money!",
"Probably should just pay more money and get a new one.. It was not upgraded to the newest iOS that it could have been. I required at least OS high Sierra for my school platforms to run and had to do all the upgrades myself. You would think they would have done this for me in advance. Also the charger they sent me is a ratchet piece of trash.",
"Regrettable purchase. This MacBook had not been prepared properly for sale. It took a lot of extra work on our part to make it usable. We almost returned it and sometimes still wish we had. It is also VERY slow. Not a good purchase, unfortunately",
"Works well. I use the MacBook for school (graphic communication) and it does the job fine. The laptop is a lil slow and display isn't as high quality as current models but it's close enough for the amount you pay for.",
"2012 MacBook Pro. It\u2019s a mid 2012 MacBook Pro at a good price it\u2019s good for a year or two even refurbished one",
"working poorly. battery needs to be replaced the the apple store charger $250 for a replacement. suggestions?",
"work like new. Happy it works like new so far Let's see what happens next 3 months performing",
"Speed. The laptop is good and fast, but there are scratches on the back.",
"Requred an update. Didnt have the latest update in it. Free update from apple but, not easy to find huge pain to download",
"Great laptop. Couole scratches on the too but other than that it's amazing. No problems and I've had it a month or 2 now",
"WAY OVER PRICED FOR QUALITY. The computer I purchased was way over priced for the quality of product. Keyboard letters were dirty still. There are a couple dents. Charging Cord very used....need to purchase a new one. Not happy with this purchase at all.",
"Tr\u00e8s bien. Ok",
"Great laptop!. MacBook showed up in great condition and runs nice and fast ! I\u2019m very happy with my purchase! Just like new!",
"Don\u2019t buy! Rip off!. laptop sucked, wasn\u2019t working right as soon as I got it, stuck through it cuz I needed it then couldn\u2019t return and now I\u2019m stuck with a laptop that doesn\u2019t even work",

"A terrific Christmas gift. Recipient was thrilled with this excellent product.",
"Its garbage. I use this product for work and home but instead it was garbage in my home it blanks out its very slow it runs hot and battery last only 1 hour",
"Best decision in a while.. Pleasantly surprised that this refurbished laptop was in perfect condition. Saved a bundle of cash rather than buying a new one.",
"Good computer. Good computer for the price. Scratches on the \u201cS\u201d key but other than that it works well. It gets warm quickly after running.",
"Amazing Product!!. I use this product for my photography business and I absolutely love it and would defiantly recommend it!!",

"The item arrived in good condition and in good time. The product arrived as advertised and came sooner that expected.",
"Lightweight. I need a laptop for my 13-year-old child to conduct online courses at home. It has everything needed for a basic school. The built-in cam is very suitable for Zoom chat. To complete her online school assignments. Excellent screen quality, webcam quality and online lecture sound quality. Use Google Docs, Slideshow, Drive, etc. Everything went very smoothly. Pros: A very beautiful appearance. The layout of the home scoreen is very simple.The setup is very easy to get started. Light weight. Disadvantages: average memory and speed. Certainly not a gaming aptop.",
"Excellent for Multitasking. &nbsp;This laptop is on the cheap price to meet my budget, this is a fairly decent laptop for everyday tasks. It has a very modern look. The great graphics are good for gaming and office work. It is very thin and light weight, good quality. The keys are so comfortable to the touch. Camera and speaker are very powerful, they are clear and do not lag when I have a zoom meeting with my co-workers and friends. For general purpose it is great, so far........",
"Great little laptop/tablet. 2 weeks in and so far so good. My mother's Laptop started having problems after an update was made and we are having issues getting into the computer. I decided to get this one so she can at least have access to internet to do her bills, etc. It's slightly slow to start but runs great. Has a microHDMI, so I bought the converter micro to regular HDMI so I could hook up to her monitor. Doesn't allow to use monitor as separate screen (unless I missed something) so, for now, it just mirrors the laptop screen.",
"Pleasantly Surprised - Good Value. I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves this laptop! It is lightweight and has a clear and crisp display. The hinge is one piece which is great as those kinds of hinges tend to last longer (her previous HP laptop had two small hinges below the display and one of them snapped). She likes that this laptop is upgradable and operates flawlessly. We followed the recommendations of others and did not connect to WiFi while initially setting up this laptop. If you do, setup will take much longer as it needs to download Windows updates. It\u2019s much better to let it update when you are not planning on using it such as late in the evening. It has a really nice feel to the keys and and they seems to be very good quality. We never purchased this brand before, but we thought we would give it a try as it was in the price range we were looking for. All I can say is this if the wife is happy, then all is good!!! Very pleased.",
"Good value laptop for browsing/videos, I needed a replacement power cord. I love the lightness and smaller size of this laptop (13,3\" screen), makes it very easy to take with on the go and just tuck into my binder. I haven't had any issues with browsing, emails, or netflix/youtube watching with this yet, but as others have said, this would not be a good laptop for more serious gaming or computing. Seller doesn't sell a replacement cord. I bent and broke mine just a few weeks into having it and was able to purchase a replacement from another vendor. (I wasn't able to find this answered in the questions or feedback yet, but the Soulbay universal AC/DC adapter multi-voltage with 8 selectable adapter plugs worked for me on size H &amp; 12V, but I'm sure there are other vendors as well that would work). I would also recommend purchasing a miniHDMI to HDMI cord if you like to hook up to your TV; it doesn't have a regular HDMI port. Overall, for $300, this works great for what I need it for.",
"excellent. I bought this small computer for the first time. During this period of use, I was very satisfied. The design is very good. It is light and thin. The healthy disk is very easy to operate. The speed is also very fast. I like this computer very much. It is recommended.",
"Thin, light and Cheap. &nbsp;I need a new computer for the new semester. After comparing them on Amazon, this laptop is thin, light, and very inexpensive. It's hotter at times, but I think it's good for the price.",
"Small but powerful. I'm very happy with the purchase, the package came in very quickly. I purchased this computer for my father, he doesn't use many features, he uses for web browsing, youtube, and etc. I helped him to set up after we received this computer, super easy to set up and everything went very smoothly. I'm very impressed with how fast program runs, no problem with browsing. The quality of the image is excellent, it is very clear! This is such a great deal, even though the price is cheaper than what we would normally pay for any other computers, but the overall quality and performance are the same or above than the other ones I used before that\u2019s a lot more expensive than this one. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a simple, basic features computer at a reasonable price.",
"Very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone!. Amazing budget laptop! If you\u2019re looking for a good performance laptop for work or school or whatever it is, this laptop here is probably what you\u2019re looking for. The specs on this laptop are pretty great. The 8 Gigabytes of RAM are really efficient in making this computer faster than the average cheap laptop. The design is very sleek and nice, really catches your eye and in my opinion just gives you a good feeling about just owning this computer. I use it for work and pleasure, it works great for my writing as well as web browsing! Very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone!",
"Works well except when it doesn\u2019t.. We have two of these laptops. One was gifted. The one we purchased must be a lemon. It was bought in August and the last two weeks it keeps encountering errors and shutting off. It will also randomly freeze and the screen scrambles. Blue screen of death. It was working very well for an elementary age child for school at home until all this started. Probably would not purchase again. Would not recommend to a friend.",
"Ultra slim laptop. I was looking for a laptop to replace my behemoth. My criteria were: lightweight. I wanted it mostly for web browsing, word processing, and some fairly light gaming. It took like like 3 days to settle on what laptop to buy but I finally figured out this one would be it. This is a great laptop for personal use. It is super thin and light, the screen frames are very thin, it is very stable\u3002 while might use with heavy use so much it's good though. Overall delighted with my asus I love their laptops.",
"Very cost-effective laptop. The silver-gray laptop looks very beautiful, the design is very thin, the performance is very powerful, the keyboard is very easy to use, the performance is enough for home entertainment work, the battery life is also very good, this is a very cost-effective High laptop, I like it very much",
"perfect size and working fast!. This is what I expected! Very easy to setup, I can put this laptop in my backpack and still have many room left, perfect size to carry around, not heavy and very thin. This laptop is working great with my brother printer. The laptop runs fast as expected. Great laptop for the price!",
"Good price. The price for the laptop is low. Love that it has windows on it already. It's lightweight. The only thing I wish, that isn't the fault of the product or company, is that there were protective cases for it. They have protective bags but it's nice to have a case that snaps onto the body of the laptop for protection when it's in use",
"Decent laptop value for the money. very decent laptop for this price.I have been using it for months with no big issue so far. Of course I did not do heave jobs like gaming or computation. It serves me very well for daily works like internet surfing and writing documents. I also took it while I was traveling last month.",
"Charger died after 1 month..... One month review: The laptop seems to be working well for my son. He\u2019s only using it for school so no major programs running or anything. However, the charger has already died and is not giving any power to the laptop. This is very disappointing. If it wasn\u2019t for the charger, I would give it 4 stars. For the price, this is a good laptop.",
"Great little laptop. It just arrived a few hours ago, and I haven't finished setting it up yet, but I can already see that it's going to be my favorite among my various larger screened ones that are much heavier (and cost much more). I'm very pleased with it in every way.",
"EXCELLENT COMPUTER AT A GREAT VALUE!. THE PRICE OF THIS COMPUTER IS A STEAL. IT IS VERY FAST AND POWERFUL.PEEFECT FOR MY EVERYDAY NEEDS. THIS LAPTOP IS AS POWERFUL AND SLIM AS MANY OTHERS THAT ARE HUNDREDS MORE. IT IS ERY VALUE FOR THE MONEY. I AM VERY IMPRESSED.",
"Impressive laptop!. Low price and works great! I use it primarily for internet, photos, and word documents. Not sure how it works for gaming, etc, but works great and fast for my purposes.",
"Nice power for a small inexpensive laptop but some issues with keyboard. The mouse pad quits (lose cursor) and certain keyboard characters act funny (\"L\" suddenly repeats, certain keys hard to press). L key and mousepad ok after reboot. Everything else is fine.",
"Great value for money. I am far from a computer wiz but this laptop meets all my needs. Its userfriendly, lightweight and its a great price. Highly recommend for basic computer needs.",
"Jump for joy for Jumper. I don\u2019t have much money to spend on a laptop so value for the money counts lots. Much faster than my last one. The set up is easy &amp; the color resolution is just fine.",
"My son loves it. &nbsp;I purchased this laptop for my son for school.He loves the color, which surprised me. Nice and slim. Not heavy at all. Enough ram and storage just what he needed. The speed is good and has not had any problems with it, so far so good.",
"It work good. This computer is a gift for my dad. He does not need a very advanced configuration, so this computer is very suitable for him, simple and lightweight, and the battery is also very durable. He likes it very much.",
"User-friendly convenience without breaking the bank!. I received my brand new Jumper EZbook X3 this afternoon and set it up after charging the battery for an hour, easy peasy. This lightweight laptop is a great combination of performance and affordability in one sleek, compact design. I'll be re-immersed in my studies in no time!",

I like this laptop it is pretty decent,and good.Its battery last up a long time so I am able to use it for a whole day.It is good for work and play.Easy to control the mouse.Charges up really fast and easy to use.Really thin which is easy to put in my backpack and I can carry it anywhere I need it.Good quality.It loads up fast as soon as I open it in at least 10 seconds it loads up.",
"Great buy for the price. My daughter wanted a laptop to play roblox on and this has worked out well. It was affordable and came with windows. It's very lightweight and slim. I love it for her.",
"Great for school work and normal use, can only run simple games like league of legends. Great for school work and normal use, can only run simple games like league of legends, so if you are wanting to play games as well this is not your computer. However if it is a good reliable computer you are after then this is it.",
"Great for Sims 4 mod/cc players!. I purchased this laptop to play Sims 4 with mods and custom content. I have about 10 mods and hundreds of custom content items. So far, everything works just fine!! My game doesn't glitch and everything works and shows up just fine. Edit: it's been a few months now, and I have about 20 or so mods and hundreds more cc, laptop is still running fine!",
"Not Zoom-worthy. Within 20 days, the letter T would only type the number 2. Also, the camera was of really low quality on this laptop. Video images appeared out of focus and very dark on Zoom.",
"Not worth. Within 3 months keyboard having issues.. slow speed, had to restart multiple times.. add couple hundred dollars and get good branded product.",
"Need a refund! Sending back!. Does not work ! The mouse doesn\u2019t move! It goes black when I\u2019m looking online!",
"It's a nice laptop for that price.. Just got this laptop. I cannot say much about it now, but from first glance it looks supre clean. It can do much task, but no heavy lifting from the few moments of using it. I got it for my nephew so it's not like we have some big requirements, but it should suffice for now. Good price for this product.",
"Be careful about the specifications and screen size. Screen size of the laptop I received was 15 inch however the description says 13.3. I\u2019m on the go most of the time and care a lot about the screen size and cannot keep this laptop. Big disappointment.",
"Love it!. Love this Laptop! Would buy again! Simply great!",
"Great value!. Only had for a few hours but so far excellent",
"Great laptop. Great laptop and a great price. Light and fast. I'm very impressed.",
"Stopped Working in One Day. Without a doubt, the worse purchase I have ever made in my life. I bought this laptop for my son. It didn't even last 48 hours. It won't power up. The low price and the 8 gigs of RAM were the incentives to buy, but this experience proved the old adage, if it seems to good to be true, it probably is.",
"I\u2019d buy a larger model. Not as bad as I\u2019d thought and has a few secrets to its success",
"Great product for the price. This laptop was bought to provide class online services to my 7th grade son. He loves it and uses it everyday for school on line classes and homework. Very slick and well design.",

"Great value and delivered fast as f. Alright, after just receiving this today, I'm mostly impressed, mostly. It's smaller than I thought but that's perfect because I'm doing remote work, and I should've read the details on that. It looks great, it's simple but neat, and no annoying stickers on the keyboard! After charging it I personalized everything and it did get really hot but I was installing a lot of updates and that. My only gripe is the audio volume is really low, but I looked online and replaced the driver and modified some things and it's better. It could still be louder though. For the price, it's fantastic and was actually shipped to me in 18 hours! Fastest delivery ever, and needed for a job I'm going to be starting. I may update but so far 4.5 stars, but can't give it 5 with the sound problem, and I'll say overall I give it an A for value and delivery speed.",
"Heats up like a nuclear reactor. I opened it up, turned on the power, and began to set up Windows. I had the laptop on my lap and could feel the bottom of it rapidly heat up. I hadn't even started to do anything intensive on this device and it was already hot from the setup. Maybe I could forego this temperature mishap. I ran the benchmarks to figure out whether this was worth $250. Userbenchmark couldn't even identify the drive and ran into problems when trying to run tests, which resulted in an incomplete benchmark. Another red flag. Userbenchmark is to be taken with a grain of salt when trying to determine whether a computer is worth its price tag. However, it doesn't take in-depth tests to realize that an Intel Celeron laptop isn't worth $250 when I can pick up a name-brand HP Ryzen 3 for $50 more, which\u2014 mind you\u2014 doesn't turn into a fireplace within the first five minutes of startup. The Ryzen is much more capable of running intensive tasks. When you're trying to figure out the best bang for your buck, you look for computers that don't make the internals smolder from setting up Windows. This is bad for its longevity and bad for your wallet because the laptop is gonna fry within a year, and you'll have to get a new one. The two stars for this laptop are for the 1080p screen and the 8 GB of RAM. Its Celeron is really bad. This product is a new release and there are no reviews older than a few months, so nobody can definitively say it lasts. Get another laptop and don't let the craze of quarantine make you go for the first laptop you find on Amazon.",
"Two Returned within 2 weeks. Purchased these laptops for my children's schooling. Within 3 days of receiving them, one had to be returned because it would not hold a charge and only operated when plugged into an outlet. A week later the keyboard completely stopped working on the other one. If just one had been defective, I might have just assumed I received a bad apple in the bunch and quietly returned/replaced it. But in this case, BOTH computers were non-functional within 2 weeks of receipt. These are junk. Look elsewhere.",
"It is slow as a turtle stuck in molasses. This thing is slow. As a new computer it should have the latest updates you would think. But when surfing news feeds and trying to view a slide show half the time it takes the script a minute to catch up with the picture images. Like you could be on picture 2 but the script from the previous picture 1 is still showing instead of that describing the current image. It is just not working as fast as my previous Lenovo which only had 4gb of RAM and this one is supposed to have 8 GB. All I can say is BAH!!",
"Unsatisfied. This laptop is slower than my other laptop, although I bought it because it supposedly should process twice as fast. It doesn't. It's slower, and so it can't replace my last laptop as intended. Worst of all, every time I move the mouse pad, there is a soft electric zapping noise coming out of the laptop. I would really like a refund, but the option is missing, perhaps since it has been a month. But I've barely used the laptop.",
"Stopped Working After Two Weeks. It was going great straight out of the box. Then two weeks later, the keyboard stopped working. So, I turned it off, now it won't turn back on. I need it for work. Now, I'm wasting a day.",
"Stopped working. Stopped working after a week.",
"Only worked for 4 months. After only 4 months, this has suddenly stopped taking a charge. There are no issues with speed or anything, but the battery will no longer charge. It has been plugged in all night and day, and there is no change even after changing outlets. My phone charges fine from the same outlet. When I came to change my review, I realized that the product page has been changed to a completely different product at 3x the price. Seems very shady. Do not recommend. Edit: I purchased a new charger and it still doesn't charge. It is an issue with the laptop.",
"Good value, but not good enough for me. This is not a bad computer, it's a run of the mill and nothing special, but it will definitely work for everyday web browsing and small functions like word and other windows based program. I returned mine because it just didn't have enough under the hood for some of the projects my daughter was doing. Still, good job jumper, keep evolving.",
"Amazing budget laptop!. Amazing budget laptop! If you\u2019re looking for a good performance laptop for work or school or whatever it is, this laptop here is probably what you\u2019re looking for. The specs on this laptop are pretty great. The 8 Gigabytes of RAM are really efficient in making this computer faster than the average cheap laptop. The design is very sleek and nice, really catches your eye and in my opinion just gives you a good feeling about just owning this computer. The price of this laptop is really great for everything that it comes with. The graphics on this are amazing. It runs on 1080p which lets you watch movies or play games with one of the cleanest graphics. This laptop is also incredibly portable. It\u2019s so easy to bring anywhere. It doesn\u2019t weight much at all, so bringing this around for your daily job or school work isn\u2019t a hassle at all. The material on this laptop feels almost like the ones of a macbook air or similar to it. This gives it a feel of good quality and durability. The keyboard and everything are really well placed and spaced, and the laptop just feels great to type on and use. Similar to what i said earlier, if you really need a high performance laptop without emptying your wallet, this is the one right here.",
"good for online lessons,good price!. &nbsp;My son\u2019s back to school season has arrived. This year ,because of covid-19,most children have chosen to take online lessons. I have used an ipad at home for several years,and the speed is a bit slow , So I have to buy a laptop that meets the basic requirements to assist in online lessons. I ordered this one laptop on amazon, and luckily it arrived before school started. My son like this personal laptop very much. As soon as he receives it, he can experience it. It runs at a very good speed. My son quickly installed google classroom and google meet. It was connected to the school on wednesday. The online class at home went smoothly and very well. It is highly recommended that students buy one ! Good price! Online shopping is also very convenient!",
"Good for regular used. I bought this small laptop for my online classes and my work form home sometimes. This little laptop is perfect for the regular person. It's durable. Light weight and fast. It meets all the requirements for most remote positions. It has 8 gb ram. It keep things running nice and smooth. The only con is there is no backlit keyboard. Other than that. I am so satisfied with the little laptop. It meets all my expectations for school and work.",
"perfectly worked. This Jumper laptop is very useful especially during this time. Many people have online class right now and this computer is a good computer to buy when you\u2019re on budget. This computer is only suitable for doing basic things. I\u2019ve been using this laptop lately and everything works amazingly! This computer is Windows 10 and has the latest technology. When you\u2019re setting up the computer, you can set up the language you want. The design itself is very modern and sleek. The size of this laptop is just the size for me. It\u2019s very compatible and can fit in small bags so it can easily be carried around.",
"Working very great. I received the computer these few days. The packaging is very good. I opened the packaging and felt the texture of the computer was amazing. It was completely unexpected. Then I opened the computer and used it for a few days. The charging is fast and the battery life can be used. For a long time, I like it so much,",
"good laptop. A very useful laptop. The weight of the computer is very light, the size is also small, suitable for carrying around. Can be put in the work bag without using too much space. The computer's clear reading is very high, and watching movies is good. Its processor is very fast and can run several different software at the same time, which is very convenient for work. That is, the USB interface is relatively small, and another USB extender is needed. The price is also very affordable, and overall it is a good laptop.",
"My parents love this laptop!. I bought this laptop for my parents. The price is very reasonable for the spec. They mainly use it for web browsing and stock trading. It is easy to set up, the laptop is not one of the largest compared to other laptops, yet it is portable and it fits their needs better as they travel a lot. The speed is fast enough for them, overall it is a great laptop.",
"Does the work to my expectations. From initial set up to current state, I have been very satisfying with the performance of this laptop. This laptop is very comparable to other top brand laptops but at a much cheaper price. Especially suitable for students for non heavy programs. I mainly use this laptop for photo editing and sometimes streaming. Graphic quality is to my expectations. It has been a pleasure to own.",
"Great laptop. I bought this for my cousin and he is very happy about it. lightweight fast, great speed, and easy to setup. The battery lasts longer than I expected and the camera and sound quality are decent.",
"Great first laptop PC for school. This laptop PC is for my 10 years old boy, due to the pandemic, he is staying home for online school, this laptop is just right for my boy, my budget is tight, and he don't need playing games in the laptop, he just need it to be able to do online school, online surfing, watching YouTube, it can run 1080p smoothly, it is super lightweight, the touch pad is bigger enough, easy for him to carry.",
"Super Amazing. I been looking a for a laptop computer after my other laptop broke. When I get this laptop It was great. Very easy to bring around. Reasonable price and god costumer service.",
"Can meet daily needs. The price is moderate and can meet daily needs. Equipped with a 13.3-inch 1920x1080 resolution FHD IPS screen, it can be easily slid into a backpack or small school bag",
"Great PC. I didn\u2019t expect to receive this such a great pc because of its cheap price. It was surprised me when I first received, the weight is light, the designation made it looks great. The 8+128 memory is good enough for me to read news, watch movies and so on. The size also is perfect for me to carry around.",
"The perfect laptop!. The computer is very good! It is not easy to buy such a good price at such a price! This brand computer from China is very good! high speed! The processor is worth the price! Recommended",
"Cheap but quality is cheap. It is cheap Quality is very cheap",
"Great buy!!. This is a premium windows laptop at a great price with all the features to do office work as well as for kids school. it was simple to setup out of the box and was up and running in a few minutes. I would highly recommend this product.",
"Well worth the money and perfect for someone who works online. I love how lightweight this laptop is. It\u2019s great and gets the job done whilst being easy to transport.I\u2019m very happy!",
"Not worth of spending your money!. With all schooling going to virtual or online, I was looking for a good laptop at reasonable price. Within 2 weeks we started seeing issues. The laptop gets really hot when worked more than 30 min. The processor is slow makes you sitting in front of laptop looking at Spinnning wheels. Terrible purchase!",
"Good for work or school. &nbsp;Pretty light laptop and thin. The screen is nice and high definition, and I can watch videos with ease. It pretty fast and I can do most of work on it. Great for work or school.",
"Great value, light, quiet and suprsingly capable machine for the price - with a stunning screen!. This machine is surprisingly capable for the price! Browsing is great with multiple tabs and it works fine with the Libre Office apps for things like working with CSV files or word processing. GIMP runs fine on it for image processing with moderate files, better than expected. Gaming is going to be limited but you can still have a lot of fun. Minecraft Bedrock Windows 10 runs fine at about 20-25 FPS. And a bunch of my old classic Steam games work fine and are great fun, like Civ IV and Pirates. Burnout Paradise seems good too. Minecraft PC Edition is far too slow to be playable and forget playing most modern 3D games. But there are a ton of great games that will be fine available on Steam. It works great for a bit of Python programming as well. I use Visual Studio Code for editing and that works super snappy. The build quality is good and it looks a classy little laptop. Best of all is the small size, light weight and good battery life (about 5 hours or more depending on how bright you have the screen and what you are doing). Though maybe the star feature is actually the screen, which is stunning for the price. Looks great from any angle I would ever view from and is crisp. The laptop does not get too hot and is quiet, having no fan. The only negatives for me are that the screen could do with going a little brighter, though I am fine with it and often have it less than max brightness. The keyboard has a US layout (but a UK rubber overlay is included that is nice to use). And the USB ports could do with being a little further away from the other ports. E.g. I can't have a thick USB stick inserted while having headphones plugged in (left side) and the thick stick won't work on the right side either as it is too close to the power connector. Easily solved with a USB splitter/extender anyway. These are minor issues and for a decent spec machine like this, with a good build quality and lovely screen, I am blown away by what you get for the money. I am actually more fond of this than the high-end laptop I use for work, as that is a hulking beast that weighs and ton and this beautiful little laptop is a joy to use as a very portable yet reasonably capable machine. Love it!",
"Just run a virus scan first!. After reading a review on this product before I bought it, I noticed someone say that they found a virus on this laptop. I decided to be safe to run a virus scan on mine before I installed anything else, and it did pick something up and removed it no problem. I just used a free antivirus easily available online, and all my subsequent scans have been virus free. The reason I'm still giving this laptop 5 stars is that I'm absolutely amazed with it for the price I paid. It's fast, quiet, lightweight and easily handles anything I throw at it. It's quickly become my main device. I honestly wasn't expecting this quality for the price. I really don't know what else to say, it just works. It also starts up very quickly, even with a good amount of programs set to run at startup. For me, getting a great laptop at this price is more than worth the extra effort of running a virus scan.",
"Give it a go!. So, probably like a lot of people looking at these reviews right now, I wondered what the h... is a jumper. Never heard of it! The specs look good, the laptop looks good and definately seem to get more out of it then any random notebook laptop we looked at in curry\u2019s. Spoke with members of my family who are in The industry and they said go for it, so we did. Bit of back story, my wife decided to do a degree through open Uni and her old laptop was 8/9 years old, so we didn\u2019t need much in the way of specs for her new laptop but it needed to be smooth, do everything she needed to be able to multi-task aswell and be compact. I am really pleased we went with this, we have had it for about 3 months and it has been great! It has done everything she has needed it to do and we have been surprised at how quick it has been. It also has a very nice feel to it quality wise, makes me think of a windows MacBook Air. My wife also really like the rubber key button cover that comes with it. Battery life is very satisfactory and holds well. All in all, if your looking for the same thing as my wife, I would say definately go for it, we have been very satisfied. After a bit of research Jumper seem to be a very cool little start up that we will definately be considering again in the future.",
"Perfectly working. &nbsp;I bought this laptop for my teenage daughter who goes to secondary school and needs to do a lot of home work online. She is very happy with this laptop, it works quickly, absolutely perfect. It has Microsoft office which is very useful. The other useful thing is that keyboard cover is provided. The screen is quite bright, the picture is clear. The laptop itself is very light and thin, a bit bigger than A4. Would definitely recommend. Great value for money. If you find my review useful please press Helpful button below, thank you.",
"Perfect laptop for my children \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. This is the second laptop I have purchased, really affordable, 2 of these is the same price as the branded one with more or less the same specifications. So I decided to have 2 of them instead. It is small enough to carry around with you and big enough to look at the screen, we do have a few tablets at home but I think the screen is too small. This laptop is also very lightweight which allow us to carry it everywhere we like without too much burden. Summer time is a time that children think they don\u2019t have to do any school work , and my deal here with my children is they can keep the laptop but have to do some school work and reading daily and I got my deal they have got what they want. The quality for photo and movie (graphic) is very good, sharpe, bright and colourful!! We all have bad habit that we eat in front of laptop so the silicon cover is extremely important for me lol This is perfect laptop for my children. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Good price, great quality and grand deal",
"Excellent Value for money for this laptop.. Prompt delivery and well-secured packaging. The build and feel of the laptop is surprisingly sturdy and yet lightweight. Keyboard is responsive (even with the overlay) and the keys are large enough to be comfortable. After charging for 2 hours, I fired up and initial installation was a doodle with Cortana prompts and voice responses, even wi-fi connection was done in a few seconds with the WPS. Windows and Microsoft account settings followed and then everything was ready to go. As a student, I'm using it a lot for on-line lectures, Teams/Zoom meetings, graphics projects etc. The software download and installation of all my apps was quick and fast. The 6gig RAM means it keeps up with all applications so far and it is powerful and fast enough to cope with some demanding PowerPoint graphics and basic video editing. The screen is very clear and view angles good. Colours are vibrant and very true to life. I have an external 1TB disk and it reads and saves fast enough. So overall, for the price it is a very good piece of equipment. I will do another review after a couple of months' use to verify these early impressions.",
"Great laptop for the price.. This affordable and super lightweight laptop comes with Windows 10 Home pre-installed. It was easy to set up. Connected with no issues to my WiFi and Windows updates were installed and ready to go, inside twenty minutes for me. Has an American keyboard layout so I changed the settings to a UK layout and used the included flexible, keyboard protector overlay. It's a very thin model, with a large touchpad which I find to be very responsive. It doesn't have a touchscreen but the images and text etc. are crisp and clear. The colours are vibrant on this 13 inch screen. Battery life is dependant on usage and your settings. The claim is six hours on a full charge; I would say that's about right. It's not built for heavy gaming, more for browsing and email etcetera but it's great for playing Prime videos and movies which it handles with ease and does it well. That's good enough for me. It houses 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which is expandable by TF card. The processor is the very capable Apollo Lake N3450 made by Intel and has four processors. I'm very happy with the processing speed. Having used it for nearly a fortnight, I'm not disappointed. A very good value for money buy in my opinion.",
"Very pleased. As a mini-laptop it was more compact and easier to carry than my old laptop. My old laptop was a bit bigger and therefore had a larger screen. The downside to my old laptop was it's bulkiness, it was less convenient to carry and needed a larger surface for me to place it on. This mini-laptop, however, is just small enough and light enough for me to hold in my left hand or balance on my lap when i use it. This makes it much more practical to use on public transport or at a cafe. In terms of performance the quad core and 8 Gig memory makes it very fast and responsive. I find that the 128 GB eMMC drive is good enough for just about anything. If you have previously only used laptops with the old HDD hard drives the difference in speed is very noticeable. It's probably the highest performance in this price range. To get any meaningful increase in performance you would need to look at something with expensive processors and an SSD drive which would more than double the price. Even then you would only notice the difference if you were playing the latest games or running some very high end design software. It has a good battery life and a fast recharge time, 6 hours and 2.5 hours. It has a nice robust feel to the case and keyboard. The screen is 1920x1080 resolution which seems to be the standard for all laptops now. The picture is very clear with good brightness. All the standard ports for peripherals and upgrades. Overall high performance and the best value.",
"Lightweight, smooth operation and economical price \ud83d\udc4d. This laptop is brilliant \ud83d\udc4d I had been using it last couple of weeks and it's been a pleasant experience. Got it for my teenage cousin who required laptop for school project works and also for her personal use. This laptop serves the purpose with its specifications which does the job brilliantly \ud83d\udc4d It's a very lightweight tablet hence easy to carry around. Battery backup is quite good and goes for hours. Screen is bright and colourful. Worth the price \ud83d\udc4d. This laptop is probably one of the slimmest laptops to see on the market 2 in one feature is amazing and easy to detach and use it as tablet. Enough storage if 128GB. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a laptop for personal usage and don't want to spend fortune on the high end laptops.",
"Good start for this entry level laptop. &nbsp;So the spec of this laptop puts it at the entry level category and for what I need it for it makes sense. The laptop in grey is visually good to look at and then the keyboard is of good quality and the key sizes are good for my finger size. Set up was simple and quick and once the OS was in place the MS 365 subscription automatically commenced. So far surfing and working In Office the laptop is coping well and I can surf and work without any interruptions. The default storage position is ok for now but I have options with this laptop to expand so will do that if and when required. Happy with this laptop, good value for money.",
"Better than I thought. The laptop is much better than originally thought. I bought for my daughter who just turned 8. This was intended to help with remote working and home schooling during lockdown. Setting up windows was a little slow and I thought that I would have paid the cost of the performance as home IT admin. However after the initial setup the computer run smoothly. The computer has limited multi tasking ability (so you would need to close something if you want to have a call and web surf) however everything run smoothly. Skype, Microsoft office, zoom and mine craft run similarly to more expensive products (you don't really see any difference). The only downside is the screen which could benefit from a higher resolution and the charger which is not a usb-c plug (nowdays how dare you!). Other than that all good.",
"Confusion re. @ key!!. I brought this on behalf of an elderly relative. I can't vouch for it's performance/battery/weight as it was sent direct to them. I presume, given previous reviews, that these are good. What is disappointing though, is similar to a previous observation, the @ symbol shows as being above the Number 2, but when this is pressed it is a \" instead. The actual @ symbol key seems to still be programmed into one somewhere left of the shift button (I haven't got the laptop here so can't tell you which key, but through trial and error with my relative over the phone earlier we eventually located it). Listen, It's just a cosmetic mix up on the actual surface key lettering and if that's the only thing wrong with the laptop then it's no big deal, but it might easily have been had I not read the previous review alluding to this mix up and we would be stuck/having to return the item. Somewhere the QC check process was obviously a little lax.",
"Compact design, light weight and high quality - Great intermediate laptop !!. This laptop is brilliant when it comes to quality, looks and ease of operation !! Arrived well packaged and out of the box looks stunning. Its a nicely designed laptop which is very light in weight hence makes it easy to carry-around. Design is very sleek and compact as well. This laptop is being used almost everyday basis for multiple activities. Even playing a online game is quite smooth because of the high-config this laptop offers for the price. 128Gb storage is good for our requirement as do not store any media files which are generally of larger size. Screen display is very bright and clear. watching movies or youtube videos is a nice experience. Inbuilt speakers offer good sound quality. Overall its a nicely designed very high quality laptop and highly recommended",
"Brilliant laptop. I was using hp laptop which was same size as this laptop but stopped working. I started looking for replacement, I was basically looking for something similar in everything but do not want to spend much due to my current financial situation. I found this laptop, read all the specifications which tick all the box of what I was looking for. I bought it even though its not as popular as other big big brands. I will say that am very happy with my purchase, this laptop function as perfect as my previous hp laptop, the battery life is second to none, very sharp, bright and responsive even comes with keyboard protection cover. The operating is all same as my previous hp. I strongly recommend this laptop and why spend much money on big brands when this laptop gets the job done. I love this laptop. Thanks",
"Great little laptop - US Keyboard. This is a great starter laptop. Fast enough for most, slim and easy to set up and use. It comes with a US QWERTY keyboard with an overlay that shows \u00a3 and \u20ac. The overlay fits well but I deducted 1Star as the base keyboard doesn't have \u00a3 symbol.",
"Great, basic laptop. I am very pleased with this laptop. It was in my price range and had a basic specification. I wasn't expecting it to fly, but it has managed everything I have thrown at it. I have installed Office 365, Openshot video editor, Audacity audio editor and GIMP graphics package. All work fine (yes, the video editor is a little slow compiling but it is no biggie). Battery life is 4 hours plus and it is lightweight. I recommend downloading all the Windows updates when you get it. It takes ages, but when it is done, the laptop is more usable and secure. Setting the screen resolution to 100% gives a very big desktop and easily displays the apps I have. I would recommend this laptop.",
"exceeds my expectations. Bought to replace an aging laptop to deal with my writing needs, this machine is delightfully light in weight and accessible to me as a one-handed typist, with Win10 allowing sticky shift and control keys. More than that, it runs a full version of Microsoft Word 365 and the Amazon KDP Publishing tools. It was easy to set up and I was able to use it straight out of the box to publish my first book on the Amazon Kindle Store. The screen is beautiful in colour, contrast and resolution. The 4G RAM and 64 G eMMC are adequate. Battery life at some 6 hours between charges is okay. And without moving parts - fan, hard disk - it's wonderfully robust. My aging laptop is feeling forlorn - I shall have to give it a hug; its years of sterling service will never be forgotten! But Jumper have shaken my decades of loyalty to a certain well-known computer manufacturer of considerable standing - and expense!",
"Slim, lightweight and works well with great battery life. &nbsp;I have been using a lower spec jumper Laptop for a year or so. The RAM and ROM on this are now double what I have yet the price is still very good so bought this one. The laptop itself is a simple plain design that is very lightweight and slim. The keyboard comes with a rubber like UK keyboard as the original is us. This all works very well and actually the design is clean and nice looking. In terms of performance it is all I hoped for, we really only use it for browsing, paying bills and in the future it will be used my my eldest for uni work from September. The battery life on my older model is still around 5 hours after a year and on this its well over 5 hours. The screen quality is as clear as I could have asked for. Pages and programs load fast and without fuss. I have no complaints at all, in fact I have a lot of praise for the value these laptops bring.",
"So Upset ruined christmas. Absolutley gutted brought this for a christmas main gift set it up, tried setting microsoft 360 1 year free only give u 1 month free trial, then error came up, laptop crashed wouldnt load reset now its doing nothing, gutted to return only gift I brought for my daughter, as if this year isnt bad enough ! Ruined Christmas suprise, for my daughter to do her course to help her get a job, sadly refund wont compensate for ruining christmas \ud83d\ude2a",
"Great laptop. The laptop is very good and I am happy with my purchase. It is light and practical, I can carry it with me wherever I go. The design is modern and simple like a notebook. The performance and usability is also very good. It\u2019s quite fast and durable to play videos on YouTube. Picture quality is also bright and clear. It\u2019s a great laptop to have if you want something light and practical. I\u2019d definitely recommend this laptop if you want something affordable and good as any other expensive ones.",
"Jump to it and get one!. After doing some research into laptops/netbooks upto the 13.3\" screen size, I was directed to the EZBoox X3. Then when I saw the spec (8GB RAM, 128 GB storage, Full HD screen, metal upper body etc) all for under \u00a3250, it was a no brainer! The machine appears very well made, works swiftly, a very decent screen for watching video on (not too bad speakers too). It comes with Windows 10 and everything I've used so far works quickly and no issues - I have not however played any games on it. Came with the UK keyboard cover which will also help keep dirt from falling between the keys as a bonus. Very happy and already had several comment on it's smart design and slim size.",
"Sleek compact school laptop. After already having the same branded laptop, i felt confident that i could go ahead and get a second one to replace my sons laptop that was out of commission right before school started. I wanted a laptop capable of word processing, browsing and not much else to minimise the time spent on it when not doing schoolwork and this worked out great. He has been able to get the left over work from the holidays done with no issues, to the point that he even took it in with him as it's nice and compact and just slips into his bag. After having it, we'll probably be taking it with us on holidays as our go to laptop due to the size and convenience of it.",
"Lovely - until it packed in after three weeks. I bought this laptop to work from home in a busy role in Covid contact tracing which often involves long conversations and challenging situations. Initially it worked very well, but after three weeks the battery would not hold any charge and the thing drained of power and closed down even when plugged in. Not good when you are speaking to people already unwell and cynical of the system. Not good when your work adherence suffers. I thought it was a charger issue as the little red LED on the laptops charging port flickers on and off when plugged in. Amazon sent me a new charger and that did not resolve the problem. Looking at other reviews, it seems to be a recognised issue. Back in the box to Amazon it goes. Unfortunately leaving me without a replacement for work until it is refunded. I may be able to borrow something to tide me over but the bottom line is: Don't buy this if you are looking for a computer you need to rely on for anything whatsoever.",
"Brilliant Build and Performance for bargain Price. I ordered my laptop for my mum, she needed a laptop to check her emails, online shopping and some work training courses. we looked through amazon and saw the Jumper X3 and the description and reviews matched our needs perfectly so we ordered. the laptop arrived next day and she set it up on her OWN! which is a big deal because as a person who is not up to date with technology I thought this would have been a bridge too far, but it wasnt. the build quailty is very nice and is alot higher quality than the price would suggest, connection wise it has all the ports that are needed for a laptop at this price point and also has the added bonus of being able to upgrade the storage capacity if needed. performance wise the laptop runs fine for what she needs, once I changed the browser and uninstalled some of the standard apps that she doesnt need, it ran perfectly well, set up her emails and showed her how to browser and online shop from amazon she was away. Overall we are very happy with the purchase, it is good spec for the price and for the same price I believe you would struggle to get better for new.",
"Really excited to have this. I have been looking online for a while for a thin, slim, light, fast and reliable laptop but not very expensive, so I can carry in my purse easily. It took me a alot of online search and effort to find what I needed. then I came across this laptop on Amazon which ticks all the boxes \ud83d\ude0d. Been using it for a few weeks now and amazed with what this little beast does. It was a real treat to myself.",
"No Microsoft office 365 offered. The laptop is sleek and lightweight and easy to carry around. But the listing says you will get 12 month free subscription to Microsoft 365. But if turns out as you\u2019re setting it up they are only offering ONE month instead of the 12 they have repeatedly said they offer. Very disappointed as it requires your card details and will automatically take \u00a379.99 in 1 month",
"Works with Minecraft. Bought this for my son for his school work. He somehow managed to mess up the outlook account and while waiting for that to be sorted has installed minecraft with no issue. Guess who will be doing a lot of isolation school work once his outlook account is recovered!?! Funny how he didn\u2019t mess up the Minecraft account. I hate Windows and can\u2019t tell if this is a good Windows product. For me, it is as frustrating as any other Microsoft product I\u2019ve owned. But my son needed a computer for school work (not Minecraft) and this is nice and low cost and minus not having access to office due to aforementioned outlook issues, is up and running nicely.",
"Disappointing buy plus disgraceful return policy. I had to have a replacement as the first one only lasted a little over a month . The screen went wonky and it was so slow to boot up. This replacent has lasted a week and the same thing has happened. When I contacted customer support the first time they arranged an instant refund so I could purchase the second laptop. This time I dont want a replacement as one bitten , twice shy . Customer service I form me that I will get a refund in 14 days from Hermes collecting the computer on Monday . Absolutely disgraceful and absolutely no excuse !! I am so cross . Why on earth is it 14days after they have it back ! Very very bad customer service . I understand 3-4 working days for the money to go back into my account but two weeks . Thats interest in their bank but it leaves me without a computer . Dreadful policy.I will get one off the high street . Amazon you get zero customer service points.Update ..I was advices by amazon that I would get an instant gift card following the first return.I was told going back into my bank was not instant .since I needed a laptop asap I felt this was my only option. Reading returns policy this seems not to be the case. When I returned the second item and it too was faulty I vouldnt get my money put back on my card as it was paid with a gift card !! This is dreadful.So I will have money to plough back into amazon , funny that. Dont by the jump top laptop, it only got a star because it wouldnt let me put no stars . As for amazon ... can you tell I'm somewhat disappointed . !!",
"Very easy to set up. This laptop is the best I\u2019ve had so far. It\u2019s good lightweight and setting it up and matching with my tablet and phone was so easy, I had it set up and ready to use so quickly, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Ideal for lap or desk.",
"Issues from day 1. On turning it on had Windows update that would not load-contact tech team at Amazon and told it takes time! What Days! After saying i was going to return it they decided to help! Thought that was ok until i install a VGA device and took up alot of memory. When trying to clean up files wont do the actions required. I am now having to go and take the laptop to an IT expert to see what the issues are im experiencing with this laptop. Trouble with buying cheap! AVOID THIS LAPTOP AND MAKER",
"Good laptop. UPDATE. CUSTOMER SERVICE DID COME BACK AND APOLOGISE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ASSIST. Laptop is all it says but it was to come with 1 year free Microsoft 365. The instructions provided are terrible and when it was clear I was going to get only one month free due to not providing the detail required, I contacted Jumper. They were most unhelpful. Telling me one rep for whole area that was very busy. Basically directed me to Microsoft to resolve. I object to having to do it but needed the software so did contact MS. They did help me but it took me over an hour constantly on line trying to give relevant information and remote session . Would not buy from Jumper again.",
"Excellent Product with the high price tag. I bought this laptop as a cheap way to get on line but didn't want to spends loads of money, after checking the mixed reviews I went for it and it arrived the next day. The laptop is expensive looking and very light weight and looks really smart, the system loads up quickly and has the latest windows spec and around 5 hours battery life which is not bad for the price. I would recommend this laptop to anyone and don't be fooled because it doesn't say Samsung, Apple or Asus on the box as its a great fast product at around a 1/4 of the price of the market leaders.",
"Highly recommend. Totally love this laptop. Slim and light in weight. Powered up quickly. I do a lot of crafting and was able to download Cricut design space and Silhouette. Ease of use and set up. Would highly recommend this laptop. Loved the extra keyboard cover.",
"Buy cheap, buy twice. Thumbs down.. Initially I was so impressed, looks and feels much more expensive than it is imo. However, it was really slow and I had barely and programs installed or open and saved all my files to the cloud. It then started to show me lots of lines on the screen every time I turned it on and was completely unresponsive at one point. I sent it back and received a full refund, so no complaints on the customer service front. I wouldn\u2019t bother with this product though - buy cheap, buy twice!",
"A satisfied student. The laptop is a very good quality purchase at a low and affordable price\u200b. I decided to purchase one to make it easier to do online schoolwork. As a student, I like that it has a long battery\u200b life. It makes using it during classes much better knowing I won't have to recharge it for 6~8 hours. I also like that it's lightweight and portable. The screen size is not too small and not to large either. I like the design and it feels very well made. The performance of the device is excellent. It is fast and responsive\u200b, produces a clear and adaptive brightness image, and clear sound. The keyboard controls work well and it comes with a silicone keyboard cover, which I find very useful as it protects keyboard from dust and debris.",
"Great for the money. It took a while to warm up, but once all the Windows updates had been installed, it really kicked in. I use it mainly for browsing on my sofa, so I couldn't really say how it would perform under high loads. That being said, it's totally fit for my purposes. One word of caution - be patient while the updates are installing. It takes a while, but then if you want lightning speeds you'll have to shell out. Great for the money!",
"Great Value!. I did spend time reading a lot of reviews before buying this. I got it for my daughter (secondary school use) and was blown away by how easy it was to set up and activate office365 out of the box. I have had issues with office365 accounts in the past but the setup picked up on the user account I created for my daughter and has just worked. Out of the box and all done in less than 40 minutes - including updates etc and me faffing around with clever user names at sign up!! If any problems develop, I will update this review but so far so good. The laptop honestly looks and feels a lot more expensive than just over \u00a3200 and I am happy to recommend it to others.",
"A truly sturdy, lightweight, able machine for all my homework. The delivery was fast, efficient and curteous. The machine was well packaged and is strong and light. It works well with the applications I chose it for and with an external DVD drive is great! I use it for internet browsing, article writing, watching dvds.(With external drive) sharing photographs and Zoom meetings. easily carried, easily set up, great I would think for school children for homework.",
"Very Disappointed. Really not happy with this purchase, and would not recommend. It is only now, as I do not live with my daughter whom the machine was for, that It has been brought to my attention that 1. The machine is incredibly slow and 2. The keypad is not as standard and a flimsey overlay was provided. Obvioulsy my 1 month return policy through Amazon has now run out, but I would like if possible to send the machine back and upgrade to something worth having. If someone from Jumper/Amazon would like to comment or help, I would be very appreciative.",
"Nice design and Affordable. It's a good Windows 10 laptop, haven't experienced any issues yet. Kids like it so that's a good thing. It isn't too heavy nor too light. I advise to buy a cover for the laptop, extra protection is worth it. I am pleased with the purchase and wasn't too costly either. The only drawback it has is, it doesn't come with Microsoft Word etc. That is a separate charge you need to make.",
"Quality, lightweight build. A quality, lightweight build at a sensible price. It does what i need it to do, i don\u2019t use it for gaming but the usual solitaire etc play well. I haven\u2019t been able to connect my printer wirelessly but it\u2019s not a negative of the laptop, my printer is quite old. It will help complete the activities through studies, it\u2019s lightweight so easily portable for seminar sessions.",
"Good laptop for the price. I just needed a simple and transportable laptop do to basic tasic such as word, excel and internet browsing. This laptop does the job perfectly! It is lightweight so it is easy to transport and the performance and very resonable for the price ! EDIT: After 2 weeks this computer just stopped working",
"Good product. I bought a really bargain, good quality compared to the price I paid for it, a little slow the first couple of times, but after that it began fast enough for general office works, modify pdf, Internet and emails.",
"Jumper to the Rescue. Had a laptop meltdown during a windows update and had to get a replacement laptop very quickly for a student friendly price. This Jumper Laptop with Microsoft Office 365, 13.3 inches FHD Computer PC 4GB RAM 64GB eMMC (Intel Celeron CPU, Windows 10, Dual-band WiFi, USB3.0) was and is ideal product for my needs. It arrived in two days, only took a few clicks to setup. It even comes with a keyboard cover for those spillages or crumbs. Thumbs up for that. It\u2019s only day 2 but it\u2019s all looking good so far. Thanks team Jumper. Oh by the way, it comes with extended warranty and a gift back if you write a review \ud83e\udd2b",
"Very Good. A well designed and compact laptop. It is taking me a bit of getting used to because it has been five years or more since I bought a laptop and things have changed a little since then I have no real comment to make concerning it's gaming applicability as I do not play computer games.",
"Brilliant. Purchased three of these doe my granddaughters aged 11/12/13 years old for achool work and facebook / WhatsApp etc Absolutely fabulous value for money as a gift from Nana and Grandy .. Paid extra for virus protection and had them set up ready for Xmas Delighted \ud83d\ude01",
"Excellent Home school laptop purchase. Bought this laptop to help my 10 year old step daughter with her school work at home. My friend who has better knowledge of computers recommended this as an excellent laptop and value for money so we looked at it and it seemed like the best value. It feels made of good quality materials and it was so simple for the two of us to set up together. It has improved home schooling and she is extra happy as she can also play Roadblocks and go on you tube. You can set up age restrictions. The webcam and speakers are good. Definitely feel this is what we needed, good value for money and we are pleased with this laptop",
"Really good price and works a treat. I really like how thin and light weight this laptop is. It came well packaged and was delivered earlier than stated which I was very happy about. The sound and screen quality is fantastic. I'm really looking forward to using this laptop for my college course. Would definitely recommend!",
"Great little thing. Sceptical at first when deciding to order form a producer I've never heard off, but encouraged with all the positive reviews. Arrived in top speed time, good protective packaging both from the producer and Amazon. It was never mentioned, but the screen is antiglare, so another amazing surprise. Starts up quickly, instalation super easy. Keyboard is great, a pleasure to use. I even chanced it to install Digikam and it has no problem running a photo editing software, for as long as the files are not in RAW format, it is obviously struggling with that, but again for the spec and price it still performs. Overall super happy with the purchase, the first impression is really good.",
"Excellent. Excellent. There was an issue with the order, laptop came with a 2 pin plug charger. Amazon supplied the correct pin a day later. Excellent product and excellent Amazon!",
"Useless rubbish very slow buffers all the time. It came with a 2 pin charger for the uk usesless now i have to mess about returning it wil prob have to pay postage cause not everyone has a printer to print return label .. update had to buy the charger ..do not buy this lap top its very very slow ...piece of rubbish",
"Very good purchase, no regrets. I am so happy with my new computer. It is beautiful, compact, light weight easy to handle and travel with. The screen quality is perfect. Images are sharp and clear. It is quick to load programs. The AI is very useful and helps to set up my laptop in no time. The battery life is very good. I am looking forward to using my new computer to do exciting and productive things.",
"Great laptop. I was a bit sceptical about the laptop due to the price, however I can honestly say this is a great machine, better than I anticipated, it has a great screen and sound, it is also faster than I expected, I have already tried this for running some information and it handles it perfectly. The keyboard is American however you get an overlay which is a perfect fit for a UK keyboard. My partner loves it also so will probably never get to use it again. Highly recommend",
"Good price, arrived in timely manner.. Used mainly to attend meetings, online banking, access to e-mails, watch Netfix etc. So far so good. Caters for all my internet requirements, this laptop offers quick responses to my operating needs, easy to use. I'm happy.",
"Brilliant for the price!. I bought this for my wife. it was easy to follow the set up process and to set up an office suite for her. The rubberised keyboard overlay to use as a UK keyboard was a surprise, but the feel is much better in use than on other machines. My wife is happy with it so I am a happy man!",
"Good price for this laptop.. &nbsp;Good price for this laptop ; i recommend this laptop to those , who doesn\u2019t really like big laptop because this laptop is really small (good to handle) and it is very light ( really easy to pick up).Also I bought this laptop for my son ; it is very easy for him to do his homework , since most laptops aren\u2019t made to do homework\u2019s.The battery life is great (5/6 hours) , before recharging the laptop.",
"Good economy laptop. Had to send first one back due to an issue with charging. Replacement has been good so far. 2months Good for school work and plays roblox. Shame it is an Italian keyboard and comes with a silicone overlay. On the plus side this should stop dirt getting in.",
"Screen flickered on second day. Now, I wasn't expecting a miracle at this price but having read the reviews I did expect it to work for a while. Let's forget the fact that the speakers are so bad as to be pointless. The screen started flickering on the second day. It just wouldn't stay on ,it just flickered. I took video footage in case anyone thinks I'm making this up. Now, it did stop flcikering and then work normally after about ten minutes but I decided it wasn't worth the risk and sent it back. If you don't care about bad sound and perhaps fault wiring, buy away. It was otherwise quite performant.",
"Avoid.. Does not come with a genuine windows 10. It came up with a warning saying using a un genuine windows leaves your personal details. It is not supplied with any sort of windows product code. This product is awful and contains fake software.",
"Outstanding. My laptop recently blew up and I needed a low price machine that could handle my office applications and typing need (email, script etc.) 8GB of RAM really packs a punch and allows me to multitask and also serfe internet with multiple tabs. Space isn't huge but but ample for my needs and I can access all documents on the cloud. Perfect for coffee shop use (if they open ever again) or low risk travel companion. Light and easy to use, a win win all round.",
"Great Value for money. This was purchased to replace my wife's aging laptop. It is needed for doing home accounts, home banking, facebook and emails. It does all of this with ease. A good looking, easy to set up device that does everything we need. I have had very good help from Jumper support who responded to my emails promptly. At first the device was not recognising the SSD card I had installed, but the support desk helped me resolve this issue and all is now ok. If what you want is a compact, basic laptop for simple tasks, this fits the bill perfectly at a very reasonable cost,",
"Good quality&amp;low price. Size! Size always matters when you buy laptops. This laptop is light weighted and so it is very convenient when you want to carry it around with you. Another good feature is that the screen quality is as clear as those laptops you buy for a cost of 2x or more expensive, which is definitely a good deal for all of us.",
"Great value. Excellent laptop I bought for doing university work and it\u2019s great does everyone need and more! Fantastic price and would definitely recommend as have everything a lot of the very more expensive laptops have too. Really pleased with purchase \ud83d\ude0a",
"Value for money. Arrived in plenty of time, I'm surprised just how light it is. Only down side is it came with a free gift of which when you look into it it's all written in Chinese without being able to convert into English I've only had a couple of days but so far very happy with it",
"why has no sd slot. it is good for office working, i used use phone or tablet to do my documents work or spreadsheet, but yet, it is very un-convenience and small screen. specially when typing. this laptop is cheaper, and have good deal when i bought it. large screen and 128gb big capacity storage. it saved my time and easy to do my work. only one shame thing, it has no cd slot.. so i have to by external cd for it.",
"Easily set up within minutes. This was a replacement Laptop after my previous one died. I honestly had never heard of \u2018Jumper\u2019 but having read the reviews, i thought it was the best deal at the time. I wasn\u2019t disappointed, I was able to set it up myself within minutes (usually have to get someone to do it for) and it was ready to go! Bonus was free annual subscription of Microsoft Office which was really easy to install. So far, it hasn\u2019t disappointed.",
"Do not buy!. I bought this laptop because I came across lots of good reviews for it and the specs are a lot better than other laptops in a similar price range. When the laptop arrived, it worked fine for a week. However, it suddenly stopped turning on properly and got stuck in a boot loop (screen would turn on, logo would come up then after a few seconds it would turn itself off and that process would start again). I subsequently returned the laptop and it has taken a while for my refund to be processed. Don't waste your time or money on this product.",
"Amazon are fantastic for when you have a faulty product. Guaranteed refund no fuss \ud83d\ude0a. &nbsp;If this laptop had worked correctly it would have been great. Sadly when it opened up after been in sleep mode it flickered so couldn't use it \ud83d\ude44 I have just returned the product, be careful because it would not let me do a factory reset at all!! Very frustrating, spent 3 days using you tube tutorials none worked!! Fortunately I knew a man that could otherwise it would have been very difficult to return \ud83d\udc4d",
"Best value by a mile. Having spent a long time researching I finally decided to purchase, bit concerned it was an unknown make! Shouldn\u2019t have worried does everything brilliantly, with recent events I was perhaps slightly anti Chinese but have to concede they still make the best quality and value for money, would highly recommend",
"Good picture screen.. Cheap and cheerful, processer fairly fast and expansion bay a good feature. Picture quality very good and sound is reasonable. Battery life lets it down but overall good laptop for price, recommended.",
"Great value for money, gaming and videos too!. I bought this for my daughters 10th birthday, to say she was ecstatic is an understatement!! She was absolutely thrilled with this and so are we. She plays Roblox more often than she should, and watches hours of YouTube too. In between her \u2018me time\u2019 it\u2019s pretty good for her school work too!! \ud83d\ude02 overall fab laptop for the money, great investment and massively in very happy child!! Would definitely recommend!!!",
"Great laptop but disappointed.. Great quality product easy to set up and looks like a higher end product. Mine did NOT come with 1 year free Microsoft office 365 as advertised. Beware. Amazon stepped and gave a partial refund as a gesture of goodwill.",
"Excellent little laptop at the price.. Excellent for the price. The screen quality is very good,you could pay a lot more and not better the quality. Bought it for my granddaughter for school and she is doing everything and more. Really loves it",
"Cheap and ideal for Internet use. I liked the price because it made it affordable. I find it works just as good as a more expensive laptop. It is light to carry so it would be ideal when travelling. I use it a lot and it never fails me. I recommend it to students and adults with a limited budget.",
"Worth the money, great inexpensive laptop.. We needed a new laptop but did not want to spend fortune. This ideal for my sons school work, surfing internet, Netflix, you tube etc. Also I use it for a second work laptop to check emails and teams. Money well spent.",
"It arrived on time.. It arrived on time its taken me a few days to get used to it but I now like it. The only thing I do not like is it gets quite hot when being used on my lap. Is this unusual? Or do you think it may be faulty?",
"Excellent value and performance. Great value for money. The performance is exceptional for the price. Battery lasts well, it is very slim and lightweight and handles multitasking easily. Would definitely recommend.",
"Very affordable price. This 13.3-inch laptop is very light and the product configuration is consistent with the description. It doesn\u2019t have a brand logo. I think its biggest feature should be its high performance-price ratio. If you don\u2019t care about the brand, you can choose",
"Easy to use. I bought this computer as a birthday present for my daughter, she liked it very much. It is cheaper and easy to use. Delivery very fast.",
"goodforprice. I cannot tell you anything about this lap top as I have bought it for a christmas present so I have not used the computer at all I have only he box to see that it was ok.",
"Very pleased with the item. Arrived as advised, very well packaged and protected. Product is very good, elegant and neat. Setting up was easy and so far, only had it 2 days, all is good. Very pleased with the item.",
"Delivered on time.. Laptop received. Looks good. Currently on charge before starting up and discovering what it can do. Ok, started it up and...it's a pre-owned unit, Nicola Guthrie, whoever you are, I can't get past the log on screen as I don't know your password! Seriously! I am about to contact customer services to arrange a return.",
"Would recommend. Bought my daughter this for college. I have not seen it but my daughter said it does the job. Will see in time if it wears out but hopefully not. Would recommend",
"Keyboard. Whoever made this laptop done the keys wrong. They put the @ sign above the number 2! When it\u2019s supposed to go near the enter button above the \u2018 key. I know this due to doing business studies for 4 years and constantly working on computers. I also know this because the @ key works if I press it near the enter button\ud83d\ude44 so confusing! But a faulty",
"Not great at all. My son has used it for school work for 2 weeks and the screen keeps going off. Slow at opening up anything. Really not happy with it. But as you do... threw all the packaging out at Christmas so guessing no return!",
"Avoid at all costs! Faulty &amp; unusable within 2 weeks TERRIBLE customer service. Had it one week and the screen is faulty everytime I turn it on (see pictures), I have to turn it on and off several times to get it to eventually work. While waiting to return the laptop for a refund it also stopped charging! In the space of two weeks the screen was faulty and it totally stopped charging! Also TERRIBLE customer service. Avoid at all costs.",
"Surprisingly great quality for the price!. I\u2019m very pleased with this laptop as didn\u2019t expected much from this price range. It\u2019s arrived in well package. A perfect laptop to do work at home during Covid. The laptop is so compact, thin and very light to carry. Yet the performance is top quality. It\u2019s processed smoothly and fast. The screen quality also high crisp and clear solutions. I would highly recommended \u201c It\u2019s great value and decent \u201c",
"Good all round laptop but I'm not a gamer.. Good, positive soft touch keyboard and very responsive. Speedy and user-friendly . I use mainly for emails and web-surfing. Do all of my shopping on line these days. This is a keen and comfortable machine.",
"Not as easy to set up. Other reviews made it seem this pc was so easy t0 set up . But if like me, your a bit thick when it comes to tech. It is not so easy, my fault but got there in the end. Who do I invoice for the hair loss lol",
"Patience when installing windows updates at 1st as took mine over 3 hours.. Was going to return as it wasnt updating windows, but it did eventually update after a few hours. So have patience if you have the same issue and it will eventually install. Other than that it's good if your just looking for a cheap and simple computer of your not willing paying few 100 more for much better one. Good though and yes can play games on it, but not a gaming computer so of course a limit to fps on certain high graphic games.",
"No uk keyboard overlay. Usa key board no overlay for uk in box so as good as useless to me contacted amazon but no overlays kept by them makers office china so no phone contact .will return",
"Very good Laptop with excellent storeage upgrade options and faultless custmer Service. Love this Laptop, upgraded to 256 GB with MSata on which I reinstalled Windows 10. Customer service responded to my query promptly and effectively. Highly recomended.",
"Great compact laptop. Really nice compact laptop. Starts up really quick and gave step by step instructions how to set up - I followed it and I\u2019m non savvy ! Great quality and lightweight Only being used for school work and it does the job I was originally looking for a Lenovo laptop, but the reviews were not great, so I went for this one. Really happy with my purchase",
"Great Laptop. This is an amazing computer for the price.

"Competitively Priced Small Laptop. This is the second Jumpertech product I have purchased this year - the first was a lockdown necessity for a relative, and has behaved perfectly since Spring. I wanted an inexpensive laptop for video conferencing and this has fulfilled my expectations - easy to set up, battery life is adequate. I haven't taxed the processor too much yet but the speed is OK!",
"Great , now that things have been sorted. My first troubles with this purchase was down to Microsoft login software. No way would it accept1937,my date of birth, the computer is ace and is a powerful little tool. My beef with the software us been sorted",

When installing it said I had 1 month free trial, I activated it, then and update for 12 month appeared everytime i tried to activate it, it said error! And now has expired! Feel like its false advertisement as that was the main reason I bought it.",

Also, the keyboard is comfortable to use, especially it comes with a free keyboard cover-it helps to prevent dust entry and overall keeps the laptop clean and tidy. It\u2019s worth it for buying a laptop for this price!",
"Windows Setup Is The Pain. The product itself is very good value for money especially as it comes with a UK keyboard overlay. All Chinese laptops are made with US keyboards (no \u00a3 sign and the @ sign is moved). This PC has an overlay which makes life easier. The PC itself works fine, but the Microsoft setup is a pain and took four fours as many updates were required and lots of restarts. Once over this, everything works well.",
"Neat. generally a neat little thing to get. steams videos with only minor hiccups if you load it in too fast, not too small which is great for portability, crisp display, battery on the small side but that an obvious, the laptops thin. might be the best laptop your gonna get for this price Im a happy chappy. you will be too.",

"Processor could be better but a steal for the price.. &nbsp;I\u2019ve been testing this laptop alongside another one for a short while now. My normal daily driver is a Surface Pro 4 but I've been using this once to put it to the test. The first thing I was impressed by was the 6GB of RAM. That\u2019s more than my SP4, which cost 3x the price. Another good thing i've noticed is that you can add extra SSD memory via the onboard expansion up to a huge 1TB or by inserting a Trans flash up to 256GB. That\u2019s really impressive and will make up for the fact that it only comes with 64GB of eMMC memory. The overall build quality is okay, it\u2019s not the best but it looks nice and feels solid enough. This laptop comes with windows 10 home, a 13.3 inch Full HD Display, a very impressive 6 GB of RAM, 64GB eMMC on-board storage and Intel Apollo Lake N3350 duel-core processor. I was able to get between 5-6 hours usage time which I think is really decent. Included is a silicone Keyboard cover which feels really nice and soft. I like to keep this on, it just feels better than the plastic keys. It actually covers up the fact that the keys underneath are the US QUERTY keys. The silicone one has the UK version printed on. There\u2019s not much difference between the two though. Just a few symbols. Unfortunately, like other laptops from this brand it\u2019s the processor that really lets it down. It\u2019s not good enough to do anything but general basic tasks like surfing the internet, playing videos and word processing. Anything more load bearing on the processor and it just won\u2019t be able to handle it. You have to set your expectations accordingly with how much you pay for something, and this laptop is very cheap for what you get. The 6GB of RAM, paired with the Full HD screen, expandable memory and overall build quality make this an absolute steal. Anyone who\u2019s not going to be using heavy load baring tasks should consider buying this one. It\u2019s really decent for the price. It will be hard to find a better package at this price range.",
"Great affordable machine. For the price of this and decent enough spec', I thought it was a no brainer, as my Sister had previously spilled some Bailey's Liquor over her last Laptop, which didn't turn out too good. :( She told me that this one is great, as it is nice and responsive compared to her last one and the keys are comfortable for prolonged use. There is no '@' or '\u00a3' symbols on the actual keyboard, but it is the right command when each button is pressed and not what is shown on these keys. The Laptop did actually come with an included free, soft key cover, which was a nice bonus, that does have the right symbols marked on it, so no real foul and it was great to see they were concerned and catered to the customer. My Sister told me that it has a quick charge battery, which is always good and also that it has a good camera for meetings and video use, which she is having to use more, no due to working a lot from home. Highly recommended and a great deal. Many thanks. :)",
"An excellent entry level, good quality laptop!. For the money I think this a fantastic, high-quality, compact, entry-level laptop and its perfect for your everyday use. It comes well packaged in a mostly plain brown box and with the laptop you get a 2m power cable with UK plug, silicone/rubber keyboard cover to change the layout to UK, and a 1-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal (worth \u00a360 or \u00a35.99 a month on its own). The laptop has a 13.3\u201d 1080p 60hz display, Celeron N3350 Processor (mine boosts to 2.3GHz), 4GB RAM (3.85GB usable), 64GB Hard Drive (56.6GB real capacity), and Windows 10 Home 64-bit installed. The design of the laptop is very stylish and its pleasing to look at. Its lightweight yet its looks and feels very good quality, the screen or keyboard have very little flex to them, and the hinge feel smooth and should stand up to the test of time well. There are four large rubber feet which provide excellent grip when placed on a surface, the large trackpad features an integrated left and right mouse button, and there are blue LEDs along the top of the keyboard to show the power status, caps lock, and whether the touchpad is disabled. There is a removable cover underneath to install a M.2 SSD, the screw for my cover has been rounded off, I assume this was done by a machine at the factory so hopefully just a one off. The keys are good quality, nicely spaced and have just the right amount of travel to them. The included cover which gives you a UK layout (as long as its selected in the Region options in Windows) feels softer to type on but I prefer the responsiveness of the keys without it on and I\u2019m used to typing on a US layout anyway. The trackpad responds well to touch and while I\u2019m not the biggest fan of using them I didn\u2019t come across any problems with this one and I like the integrated mouse buttons. The performance is excellent considering the cost of the laptop, it will handle any general task you throw at it and its ideal for use alongside your main computer when your away from it or it makes for the perfect entry to a Windows PC if you don\u2019t want to spend too much money. It cold boots to the desktop in around 55 seconds and takes 3-5 seconds when launching Edge or Office programs for the first time which is very respectable. It can be a little slow when loading content heavy websites like YouTube but once loaded it can play 4k video just fine and wireless internet speeds are good giving me a download of 72Mbps and upload of 43Mbps with full signal when running a speed test. The onboard graphics are powered by Intel HD 500. The display and sound are both very good. The screen is bright and the images are colourful and sharp, you don\u2019t get any glare on the screen if there is a light is behind you and the viewing angle is acceptable if your sharing the screen with someone. The sound is more than good enough, there are two speakers on the underside which can be turned up to a decent volume, I\u2019ve had worse speakers on laptops that cost a lot more than this, you can easily watch a movie/video or listen to music using them and I\u2019m happy with the way they sound. The battery life isn\u2019t too shabby, I seem to get consistent results of around 3 hours use when using it for browsing the internet and watching videos, this is using it in Best Performance mode and with the screen brightness set to 100%. I\u2019m sure you could get an extra hour or so from it if you use a more battery efficient setting. Overall, I really can\u2019t fault this machine given the cost and how useable it is. It can be a little sluggish sometimes, but it\u2019s done everything I\u2019ve asked from it and I haven\u2019t got frustrated with it once so that\u2019s always a good thing. Its excellent to travel with and feels well-made so hopefully it should hold up well. With an Office subscription included I think this is an excellent package to get you started out in a Windows computer environment and it\u2019s a product I definitely recommend. I feel this is well worth the full five stars!",
"Great value with good functionality. I\u2019ve never heard of Jumper laptops before, but thought I\u2019d give it a try as needed a laptop for home-working, and I\u2019m surprised to say that I\u2019m really quite impressed for the money. For a little over \u00a3200 you get a decent laptop that does everything you need for office working. I already have Office365 through work, so easily downloaded and installed it on the laptop, including the rather essential Microsft Teams (or Zoom etc.,) - where would be without it in these Covid days! The laptop was simplicity itself to set up, as you just follow the onscreen instructions. Windows 10 runs very well on the laptop, which though it doesn\u2019t have the speediest processor, it is perfectly adequate for what you need for office or School work in my view. Of course this laptop has very little storage, but with 1TB on OneDrive and multiple other cloud options available, you really don\u2019t need it, and you have the added bonus of all your files being backed up and available across all you devices. The laptop itself has a look similar to Apple, with a low profile and sleek lines. It\u2019s also nice and lightweight, so no problem carrying around with you. Keyboard wise, it comes with an American keyboard and has a UK overlay, which when I read about it on the product page I wasn\u2019t too keen on, but how wrong I was. The soft silicone UK QWERTY keyboard overlay which fits snugly and doesn\u2019t move, and provides a very comfortable action and typing experience. I\u2019m a touch typist and honestly you wouldn\u2019t know that you were typing on an overlay, so don\u2019t let that put you off. So overall I\u2019m impressed with this entry level laptop from Jumper. Why pay more for a more well known brand, when from my experience this is just as good, and I\u2019ve had many different brands over time. This is such great value and has good functionality, definitely recommended from me on this basis, 5 stars.",
"impressive budget laptop. it's a budget laptop but doesn't feel cheap and the hardware does exactly what it needs to for surfing the internet from youtube or using it for work it does the job. its lightweight yet feels durable materials are fantastic for the price point, the keyboard feels brilliant to use, the touchpad is responsive, doesn't feel slow the celeron n3350 1.10ghz is snappy with the 4gb of ddr3 ram, can have multiple chrome windows open at the same time and it won't feel as if itis struggling. it's a good all-round budget laptop its well worth the money, would be ideal as a first-time laptop or for just on the go, would highly recommend. Screen is decent runs 1080p videos easily, OS looks nice and sharp and the colours are vibrent. will need to update the HDD space but that isnt a problem you have the option of TF or SSD space in them formats is really cheap nower days, i ordered 500gb SSD for under \u00a330, its well worth the upgrade with this laptop.",
"Budget laptop with decent performance. I was not expecting much from this chines Ezbook X3 Laptop, but I have to say it works well. It has a lot of pros and cons but it's fully functional and most importantly affordable for a price of a tablet you can have a full functional Laptop (at time of this review the laptop cost \u00a3203). Arrived in a brown box with the Laptop securely located between four plastic foam cradles to protect from any damage. Box also contain a User manual and a charger. After I took it out of the box, I've immediately realised why is this laptop so cheap?! The biggest shock for me it was the charger, I'm not joking it looks like the AC adapter from my Charisma tree light. The other thing that makes this laptop very cheap is the built quality, although it is advertised that it has an aluminium body but I think it\u2019s only the top side is aluminium the bottom part is plastic. Unfortunately, the lid can't be lifted by one finger and it's a little but flimsy so I would recommend to open it up from the middle part. The keyboard is black and the trackpad is the same colour like the body of the laptop which looks really cool. The keyboard has no backlit and it comes with an extra English keyboard soft film. They are very responsive, has a good amount of travel. The trackpad is also responsive and confirmable to use. It comes with all the usual port including 2 USB port, a microSD port, headphone jack and mini HD port. It's pretty basic but you don't need more for everyday use. The 13.3\" screen surprisingly nice and sharp with the 1920x1080 resolution, has really good colours and it's bright enough to use it indoor and outdoor too. What\u2019s inside? the laptop is driven by an Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core processor (Single Core Burst, Multi-Core Burst max 2.3 GHz) which was primarily designed for inexpensive notebooks. Comes with 4GB DDR3 Ram and 64GB eMMC storage which is not much (again another reason why it's a cheap laptop) but it can be extended up to 1TB SSD or with max 256Gb microSD card. It comes Pre installed Microsoft Windows and after a few steps of activation process you will also get a full year of Microsoft 365 Personal subscription. The laptop performs well for everyday use such like browsing internet, using Office, watching movie etc. It's very quiet thanks to no fan installed into the laptop. Battery life is very impressive, I managed to get 5-6 hours of moderate use out of this 4500mAh battery and then to fully charged it takes just 1.5-2 hours which is great, I think. Overall, I think this is a great budget laptop. For a price of 10\" tablet you can buy this laptop with bigger screen and keyboard, great for doing basic staff, for travel, for business, for study or as a first laptop for kids.",
"Surprisingly speedy and can handle HD graphics well. &nbsp;The performance of this laptop is surprisingly fast, But the keyboard layout is a little weird as most keys work fine but some are guesswork, Such as the hash key, Pound sign and Del key. Thankfully they have provided a soft flexible natural cover that goes over the keyboard to protect the keys from getting dirt inside the edges of the keys, But also shows the correct keyboard layout. I appreciated this feature, As some thought has been put into solving this issue. Be careful when setting up or logging in to your email password, As you will need the keyboard cover to input the correct keys you want. The time can be corrected in 'settings' 'date and time' - after installation is complete. The lid flexes to an upright position, But does not go further back than a horizontal stance. It has a decent sound, Loud enough to hear in a living room, But slightly tinny. It can't backup unless you have a spare external drive or an SSD drive. After updates and a few basic programs installed, It left me with 25gb of storage. I would recommend using an SSD drive that can be easily installed underneath a dedicated slot under the laptop It plays HD videos surprisingly well, With no lagging and the graphics seems to be up to a high level for such a compact laptop. I would recommend this for browsing, Emails and YouTube videos. With the extra SSD added, This would make it perfect as an affordable portable work laptop that's lightweight and performs well. The price point is excellent on the wallet and is ideal for families and kids.",
"Impressive for the price.. I\u2019ve been using this laptop for a little while now. I can say that I'm very impressed with it. I decided to place aside my current tablet and use this as my daily driver to put it to the test. This laptop for it\u2019s price it does well on general internet browning, word processing and any small day to day tasks. Where this laptop lacks is in the processor. It\u2019s not really capable of heavy tasking or big taxing programs. I do wish the processor was a little better though as it\u2019s really the only thing that lets it down. But again, you have to consider what you\u2019re paying for. It\u2019s much lighter than my surface pro 4 which I use on the move and is easier to have it sat on your lap. It\u2019s quite nice not having the SP4\u2019s stand digging into my legs. I think the build quality is again good enough, it has windows 10 home, a 13.3 inch Full HD Display, a respectable 4 GB of RAM, 64GB eMMC on-board storage and Intel Apollo Lake N3350 duel-core processor. It all add up to a respectable laptop that can serve well for someone who just needs to use it for everyday tasks. You definitely won\u2019t be able to use this for any kind of editing software or gaming or anything like that. It\u2019s just too much for it to handle. I do like the battery life; it lasted a just over 5 hours and i was putting it though it\u2019s paces at the time. Something I did notice was that the keyboard symbols are not in the UK style but there\u2019s and included silicone cover to go ever your keys. I actually like it better with it on anyway as it feels softer. I think this laptop would suit maybe students that will use it mainly for word processing and maybe the odd internet browsing. The included 12-month subscription of Office 365 would also be a huge benefit to them. In conclusion, it\u2019s a really decent laptop at it\u2019s price range. Ideally the processor could be better but then again, the price would have to be bumped up. All in all, it\u2019s very good value for money.",
"Basic though reliable and good value for money - perfect school laptop.. I did try to upload a video with detailed overview of the laptop, but it did not go through, so here is the long(ish) narrative to explain what my view of this little unit is: 1. It is a tiny little thing that is easy to carry around as not only is it slim and small, but lightweight too; 2. Despite its fragile appearance, it is a robust little thing, as my daughter knocked it off her bed a few times, and granted it only landed on her plush carpet, it still survived the fall both times, so the insides must be robust and the screen sturdy; 3. it is good-looking and the screen quality is surprisingly good - I have recently reviewed an inexpensive monitor, so can compare like for like - this one is on a par with far more expensive laptops when it comes to the visual produced - it is crystal clear, no pix-elation anywhere, no blurriness, sharp focus, vivid bright colors, etc. 4. It has Microsoft suite included -as far as I understand there is a 9 month subscription and that on its own is a third of the price you pay for the laptop itself, so you are actually getting the device at a reduced price anyhow, if you count the cost of the software in... we stopped the subscription for my daughter, and saved in access of seventy quid immediately; 5. It is perfect for all sorts of basic school work, as it is the case in my family, and as its processing power is not that great, you cannot run twenty thousand applications all at once, so it is brilliant when trying to ensure your kid DOES work and not pretends to multitask by watching films, browsing the net, chatting to their mates , playing games AND typing their school work in all at once! It just will be so slow that the kid will have to choose which of the host of activities should take priority! 6. The mouse pad is sensitive and on a par with my expensive machines 7. It is a bit slow when booting up, but once up and running - it meets all your basic needs in quite an effective fashion. 8. it is a perfect laptop for a school kid and is such a must-have at the time of the increased focus on home learning. We have used it for a month now and my daughter has not complained once! This is her fourth computer and the cheapest one too so she has a lot to compare it to...still...no moaning.",
"Great Value Laptop. For the money you really can\u2019t go wrong with this laptop. While the brand might not have the kudos of more familiar ones this is a surprisingly well-finished product. It\u2019s nicely designed, slimline and importantly doesn\u2019t feel cheap and works well. The screen is bright and clear and the trackpad is responsive (cursor sensitivity wise and also the pinch/expand/reduce function). This particular model comes with 4gb of RAM which doesn\u2019t sound much (it isn\u2019t) but still sufficient to run all the applications without any noticeable lag (there is another model around the same price that comes with 6gb RAM but without a year\u2019s office 365 thrown in - and I would go for that one unless you need Office). It fires up quite quickly and Windows 10 runs as it should. This model comes with a UK keyboard overlay: I was expecting this to look/feel a little disappointing but in fact once in it fits that well you won\u2019t even notice it (and it\u2019s a nice keyboard to type on - responsive and quiet). I\u2019ve used this laptop for most purposes and so far I\u2019ve found it reliable and generally a pleasure to use. Sure, it\u2019s not going to blow you away performance wise (and as for games you may as well forget it). But for general browsing,leisure (iPlayer, YouTube etc) and school/university use this is perfectly adequate. In short, if you want a nice budget laptop that does the basics well - look no further. Recommended.",
"Smart looking laptop with a big heart.. Smart looking little laptop with a big heart. I love everything about it, the screen quality is crisp and clear with anti glare to reduce reflected light. For the laptops price point the laptop is elegant, slim and really lightweight. It looks a little bit like a macbook air, it loads very quickly and I have no problem with wifi connecting. The keyboard is easy to use and has a protective cover for it which is great, no more dirty grooves. Battery life is good upto 6 hours dependent on how you use it. The laptop is portable so you can take it anywhere. The laptop comes with microsoft 365 pre-installed for one year, theres also Word, Exel, Powerpoint, Outlook, Onenote, Publisher, Access. Overall, fantastic little laptop, great value for money. I would recommend this product.",

"Battery life is woeful. This is my second laptop of this make during Covid and getting fed up now as last one had a line across screen when watching videos. This one the Laptop is quick, good image but battery should last longer than the time it takes to watch a single movie. I have charged this thing 4 or 5 times and only had it a day or two. Sending it back as this won't last me two weeks at this rate let alone the length of the warranty. The laptop also gets very hot during use and whilst charging so maybe it has got a faulty battery inside. Oh well, go back to using my old 2 in 1 tablet/laptop.",
"The MacBook Pro You've Been Waiting for.... If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock. The good. - Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications. - Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome. - Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4\" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze. - Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand. - Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation. -Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity. - Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the \"happy medium\" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button. - SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively. - Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings. - Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly. - Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.\"4 (now 16\") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced. The Bad - Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk. - BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model. To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro. If you're upgrading from the 13\" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo. Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.",
"Why are you buying this thing ?. The performance differences between it and it's predecessor are marginal, at best ... Yet you are being asked to pay $2400 for membership. Think back to around 2015, when the previous gen entry cost was still $ 2000, then they changed it to $2400. For that, you got shafted with a crap keyboard, a failing display, an identity crisis for a touch-bar, and less connectivity. Now that this latest model came out and people are buying it, they are bolstering Apple's position: never apologize for hardware issues, make ppl pay extra for AppleCare+, give folks a real working keyboard and make it look like they are doing you a favor so the prices are .... what .... justified ? Apple's pricing schemes make you wonder if they think they can get ppl to believe that hardware is actually comparable to a commodity, or something like that. Lastly, you do not know what kind of quality issues lurk behind these new models ....",
"Finally, the Macbook that I've been waiting for.. Edit: The prices change quite a bit, and Amazon doesn't do price-matching, so keep an eye out for that. There's a website that shows the lowest price for each configuration, so check that out first before buying. I ended up returning my i7 MBP to get the i9 because 512GB of space just isn't that much, and definitely wasn't enough for my purposes. Both are excellent machines and I'm waiting to see how hot the i9 gets under sustained load. I used to have a lot of apple products, with my last macbook being the 2012 13 and 15\" macbook pros. I ended up giving those to friends as I transitioned to a new windows-based laptop for college. 7 years later, and I finally had a compelling reason to purchase the newest MBP: a normal keyboard, USB C, larger screen, and improved thermals. My main gripe with thin and light laptops like the Dell XPS 13 and Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th gen) has been that their thermals are awful. My hands would burn up while typing, even after a good repaste and undervolt. It also didn't help that their screens were on the smaller side. I've had the new MBP for a few days now. I bought the base model i7, and while I'm enjoying it, I do wish I sprung for the i9 at the very least due to the 1TB of storage. I have handfuls of external storage, but it really gets annoying to have to go through different drives when storage fills up. I do use more storage than a typical user IMO, as I typically have Bootcamp installed along with different CAD programs, IDEs, datasets, etc. However, I'm sure the extra storage would be nice for anyone. So far, the transition has been great! My only issue so far has been the battery life - 10 to 11 hours is definitely a stretch, and I personally found myself running out of battery after 4-5 hours of heavy multi-tasking, fans at a constant 60% (basically inaudible in a packed starbucks), at full brightness, with a lot of external power-hungry peripherals. Honestly, that's not that bad!",
"Clicks while processing data. So disappointed.....As soon as I added Lightroom and started process photos, the laptop began to \"click\" during the processing phase! Obviously this isn't normal; currently in the process of returning :(",
"Don't buy a Macbook through Amazon. Maybe I just got unlucky, but the laptop I received never really worked. When going through the setup process, the computer was unable to load data from my Time Machine backup. I cancelled out of it in an attempt to complete the rest of the installation process. I had to shutdown and after that, the machine never worked again. During the boot phase it just cycled through the Apple logo/progress bar startup over and over and over again. It would almost reach the end and then stop and restart, but never fully booted. I returned it, but since it was processed through a third party, I had to pay a 15% restocking fee, so I only received 85% of what I initially paid. So I had to pay almost $400 for the pleasure of owning a broken Mac for a day. What a joy! I complained to the 3rd party and they said the laptop was fine which is baffling since I watched the machine try and boot for half and hour. I feel screwed. Maybe I just got a bad product, or maybe Apple has serious quality control issues. It's seriously making me think of giving up on Macs all together.",
"SCREEN MALFUNTION. &nbsp;its hardly been a week i bought the MacBook Pro 16\". and i am already facing trouble. whenever i play a video there is a green screen flash coming. i have no clue whats going on. i did not even install any major applications on the laptop too. This is ridiculous.",
"???. Battery life is supposed to run up to 11 hours yet mine dies at around 1-2. I've been on it right now for about 20 minutes and the battery has dropped about 15%. My laptop also begins to get really hot after using it for a while and I can hear the fans running at their maximum. I'm not sure what the issue is since the sellers are selling authentic apple products. I will be returning and just purchasing from apple.",
"New 16\" Meets the hype in my experience. I have owned the 15.4 Touch Bar model since 2016, I typed on it before I bought it and I knew the keyboard wasn't as good as my 2012 15\", but, it wasn't as bad as some reviewers made it out to be, I'm glad I bought it before the bad reviews. The 2016 was a huge upgrade from the 2012 and I can say the 2019 is a huge upgrade from the 2016. There is no one feature that is absolutely night and day from the 2016, but, every function is better. Screen quality and size, performance, keyboard (mostly non-touchbar ESC key for me), battery life, speakers, mic and thermal, it's a bit quieter than the 2016. If you have been holding out because you like the 2012 keyboard travel and feel, the 2019 travels further and feels better. I can't personally feel the weight difference in my bag, between laptop, accessories (Jabra speaker being the heaviest) my bag weighs about 9lbs so if it's 9.3lbs I can't feel it and once it's out of the bad I don't tend to move it around. It is a big larger, but, still fits in my small 2 pocket Tumi laptop bag, so the .25\" doesn't bother me either. I'm looking forward to seeing if it's as durable, I got over 300 full battery cycles on the 2016, I expect the same from this unit, but, only time will tell. Hope my experience helps.",
"Mac dropped dead right after the \"return window\" closed. Good timing, Apple!. Yes, this gorgeous machine that's fits my needs exactly DID drop dead just now, after running well for weeks. I've read that Apple installs a \"drop dead\" chip in its machines, but I never thought they got the timing as precise as this. Well done, Apple. But now I'm out my 2000 bucks (PLUS) and I have a dead box sitting on my work desk. This is not good, not even for a laugh. I CANNOT contact the seller either. Maybe they all died from the virus, or SOME virus. PLEASE, good folks at Apple and Amazon, help me! Thank y'all.",
"APPLE OUTDID THEMSELVES!!!!. OMG!!! This is my 3rd MacBook Pro that I have owned over the past few years, and I have to say this one is by far the best one yet. This is my first Space gray, and I it's absolutely gorgeous and sleek. A very sexy machine. It looks so much better than the silver. A more modern look. The screen is freaking GORGEOUS! The colors, the brightness, so pure and crystal clear. And me being an animator, graphics designer and writer, I can tell the larger screen for sure. My last MacBook Pro was the 15 inch 2015, and I thought I was going to miss the glowing Apple logo, but to be honest, I don't. When I go back on my 2015, it seems so outdated. The mirrored logo looks so much more modern. The trackpad is HUGE, and I love it. My 2015 track pad seems so tiny and disappointing now. I have no idea why so many people say they hate the Touch Bar. I LOVE IT! I can not imagine life without it. It's beautiful and as a writer I love how it recommended the corrected words. I love being able to run through videos, play music and navigate more effectively. It's perfect. Well....almost. The only complaint I would say is it goes dim in dim light. I thing it should be our decision to dim it. Other than that it's perfect. I also love how easy it is to get to the emojis. \ud83d\ude0a The Keyboard....OMG! I love it. It's so much better than the 2015. I can type so fast on this thing. It's AMAZING. I also love the backlight. It's so bright in a dark room and it doesn't bleed out like the 2015. And lastly. I LOVE how powerful this beautiful beast is. I can created my animations with no struggle. And it renders at lightening speed which means my fans of my Youtube Channel will get faster animated horror stories from me. If you are caught on the fence if you should buy it. Get off that fence right now, and BUY IT! IT'S 100% PURE PERFECTION!!!! Thank you so much, Apple. Windows users are soooo missing out!\ud83d\udc4d",
"Don\u2019t buy. I have ordered this now times and it\u2019s almost like a decoy model laptop that you would see on display at a retailer this is aweful for 2,000 laptop! I don\u2019t recommend buying it through Amazon I think they got a shipment in of fake laptops",
"the 16 inch display is incredible. High performance with many applications open. Fantastic",
"Crashes with Kernal Panics Every Day. I do not recommend buying any of the new T2-based Macbooks that Apple is producing. I received mine about a week ago, and every day, after the laptop falls asleep, it crashes and restarts with a kernel panic. I started googling and realized this is an issue affecting a number of owners -- you can search for \"macbook pro 16 kernel panics\" on Reddit or MacRumors for more information. While the laptop in general is lovely, and powerful, it's not ready for prime time, which is sad for a machine in the thousands of dollars.",
"Expensive, but a couple of features are outstanding. I finally traded in my 15\" 2015 MBP for the 16\" MBP. The old one has a better keyboard, but the 16\" is passable (unlike the ones between). The 16\" is actually smaller than the 15\" I had, so, if anything, it's more transportable. For what I do, writing, the processor speed doesn't speed up the creative process. But I figure amortizing the cost over 5 years makes it a pretty good investment. Screen resolution, for my purposes, is no different. Processor speed is for gamers, but I find launching apps from the Dock is frustratingly slow. This is a Finder issue, as apps launch but don't leap to the top. Why not? The most useful improvement for me is the log-in via fingerprint. Much faster than typing in a password. And I have to say the response is instant. I do not find the touch bar useful, because I touch type. I rarely look at the keyboard, so I don't see what it offers. Hunt and peck types may find it more useful. The lousy camera doesn't bother me, because I don't use it. But, if I did, I would be miffed Apple is unloading their inventory of 720p cameras in a high priced machine. The speakers are simply amazing. I've never heard such sound quality out of a laptop. You just have to hear it to believe. Subwoofers in a laptop? Amazing. In short, I am very pleased with my new 16\" MBP. A couple of things are annoying, but there are several additions that reassure me that there has been some improvement over that past 5 years.",
"Apple has lost me as a fan. I bought this only to find out that you can not upgrade the hard drive or ram EVER. So as technology improves and you want to get more ram or storage you have to buy a new computer. That is very disappointing coming from apple.",
"Amazon sold me a 4 year old, dented, dinged, and scratched MBP they advertised as a new MBP.. Buyers beware. I purchased what was advertised as the new, 2019 16\u201d MBP in Space Gray. What Amazon delivered was a late 2016 15\u201d dented, dinged, scuffed, and scratched laptop in silver with a screen that\u2019s loosely attached to the rest of the body. The model and serial numbers on the packaging don\u2019t match up with the laptop. These are sold and shipped by Amazon. Update: an Amazon customer service representative mentioned that a previous customer returned their old laptop in the new model laptop\u2019s box, which means Amazon knowingly sold me a used laptop instead of the new one I purchased. How many checks are failing here?",
"Stopped working after one day. The computer stopped working after 1 day. I called Apple support who recommended I bring it to an official Apple repair provider which I did.m (but due to Covid it took 1 week to get an appointment) The technician said the motherboard (or some other essential item) was not working and there was nothing they could do to fix the computer. I ended up returning it to Amazon and am waiting for my refund. I needed the computer for my business so this has been very frustrating. UPDATE: I received a \u201cshame\u201d email from Amazon criticizing that I had returned an item that had been \u201cused\u201d. It was \u201cused\u201d because I had no plans to return it - only did because it literally didn\u2019t work!",
"$2500 computer with serious issues and less than three weeks of use. Notified for return. This MacBook could be amazing. I'm waiting to see how this company handles the return. With very little and basic use, this computer is already malfunctioning. I have video of force quit application with only safari and photo apps running, stating \"not enough storage\". No other programs have been added or loaded to the computer. Video of LOUD popping and crackling over the audio while attempting to play youtube video. Computer goes into sleep mode and is unable to \"wake\", when it does it goes through a prolonged restart and then a error/report screen pops up with \"Kernel Version\" error. I have documented all of this issues and have used the computer less than 15 times since purchasing. I want my money back.",

"BEAUTIFUL BUT COMPLICATED &amp; DEFICIENT. I must admit that the lure of the new MacBookPro16\" was strong- However, in the light of day it is an expensive ticket to an exclusive club (cult of mac) that I can still appreciate, but long for the features that I love on my older MBP's (13\"Mid2010 &amp; 17\"Late2011). Miss the venerable startup chime, activity light, charging status button, magsafe charging port not to mention the illuminated Apple Logo, and all the internals that used to be \"USER CONFIGURABLE\" (ie, battery. ssd, ram, etc). IMHO this is only cost effective if it's the last computer you ever own. Otherwise, there are many more sensible (and practical) options available at half the cost. Still, I am frequently at the mercy of Mac's alluring spell, only to come to my senses in the morning...",
"Best laptop ever would be perfect with magsafe. I owned a 2012 Retina Macbook Pro bought the month they first came out. That was my first Mac and the best laptop I ever owned. It was still working basically perfectly in 2020 when my son started borrowing it from me with ever increasing frequency and I decided to get a new Mac just for myself. I had refused to upgrade to the prior generation because of the touch bar (with no physical escape key, my biggest gripe by far), the lack of useful ports, the horrible flat keyboard that ended up being very unreliable as well, and the removed magsafe charging port. I thought I would hate the touchbar as a useless extravagance foisted on us by Apple but really I'm ambivalent to it. The physical escape key on the newest model is enough for me, and makes the touch bar acceptable rather than being a nonstarter. The lack of useful ports turned out to be only a minor inconvenience as one multi function dongle for $25 got me all the ports I needed and since I don't use ports all that often anyway, is something I can live with. The keyboard on this model, although not quite as nice as the one on the 2012 - 2015 models, is acceptable. The *only* thing I can truly complain about with this model is the removed magsafe power adapter. It was such a nice feature of the old laptop - so easy to plug in, effortless in fact, with the way it willingly snapped into place on its own. With the USB-C charger of the newer model I find myself fumbling to get it plugged in and although it's not a huge deal, it's just a constant reminder of how Apple's hubris has eliminated something that was so nice, and completely unnecessarily. And it was super nice to just flick the old magsafe connector off when you wanted to move the laptop, all the while feeling confident that no matter what happened, you weren't going to be breaking your expensive new laptop because of a trip over a power cable. In terms of speed, I got the lowest rated CPU and my rough benchmarking shows it to be approximately 2.5x - 3x as fast as the 2012 low end processor. In short - this laptop really is excellent. The 2012 Retina Macbook Pro was the best laptop I ever owned, hands down, and was in excellent shape after almost 8 years of use due to its extremely durable construction. I fully expect this new laptop to hold up just as well. If this laptop had a magsafe power adapter, it would be PERFECT. As it is, I knock off a full star for Apple's hubris.",
"All Expectations Exceeded - All fears Assuaged. I really went back on forth on this Mac. I did not want to spend the money and would have gone with a 13 inch option, were it not for the butterfly keyboard issue. I even considered a Windows box, but since i use one in my job was very resistent to the idea. In the end the 16 inch with its magic keyboard was my only real choice. These things are so expensive, but I did realize that it was replacing a 10 year old MacBook Pro that still worked, so I guess you get what you pay for. After shopping around I got a pretty good deal from an Apple authorized seller through Amazon (saved $300). I took the 16Gb i-9 quad core with the standard video memory, slightly higher end card, and a 1TB drive all for $2499. I wanted more RAM, but read that the solid state hard drive would make up the difference quite nicely; which appears to be true. Okay, so how do I like it? I absolutely love this thing!!! It works so smoothly, so fast, and so well. No hang ups or lags, no glitches or little \u201cwe\u2019ll fix that later\u201d items. It\u2019s powerful and easy to use. The keyboard feels a little different, but is not a bad tradeoff for computer slimness. The track pad took me a while to get used to, but when you do it\u2019s actually pretty handy. I even love the touch bar, which I fully planned to hate after reading the reviews. It\u2019s easy to customize and it does so many things just when you need them. Example, in finder, the trash can and new folder are right there (in my setup). In Quicktime it has a scrubber bar that lets you smoothly scroll to the frame you want. Oh well, some will hate it - i like it. Performance: I realize that I am coming from a 10 year old MacBook, but I also use a pretty new Dell laptop in my work, which if you throw out the docking station is a pretty good workhorse. My only real performance needs are for home video editing, and ripping and rendering movies (which i buy) for my home server. Video editing is fun again! It adds clips and photos so fast, edits like a dream, and renders like lightning. Video conversion is something else altogether... Video conversion test case: Frozen 2 on blue-ray. Ripping with Make MKV was about the same, owing to my external drive limitations, but rendering using Handbrake was phenominal (to me anyway). It rendered the movie in high quality, H264, 1080p in about 45 minutes. I am no professional, so you will have to rate that against your own experience, but for me it was fantastic! Finally, less demanding software like microsoft Office 365, Apple Pages and friends, and VLC handle quite nicely - loading documents in a flash and never hanging up hiccuping. Oh yeah, i bought two USB 3.1 adapters and one SD adapter for about $8 each, all three with the tiny plug and short cord. That allows you to use all four ports at onc, plus they are all compact and blend quite nicely. Summary: i love this computer and don\u2019t begrudge a penny spent on it.",
"Let down because of smudge on MacBook Pro &amp; damaged box. I really love the Apple user experience. I will say the Apple box it comes in was damaged on two corners which was a little concerning and when I got the MacBook Pro out of its packaging there looked to be a scratch or smudge on the back but after wetting a microfiber cloth I use for my prescription glasses it did come off. With that said the damaged box and smudge really took away my new Apple product experience and felt let down. I\u2019m not sure if Apple sells these at discount here because of things like the box being dented but if I would have known it would arrive this way I would have just paid an extra $159 direct from the apple store. One other thing was this MacBook Pro shows it\u2019s from 2019, which it\u2019s middle February 2020 was thinking it would be built 2020. Oh well. Didn\u2019t know how to rate this post because I love the Mac operating, eco system and the feel and look of this MacBook but the things I mentioned above would be enough to buy in person at a store next time so I can see the condition of the box it comes in. The smudge on the back made me think it may have been used and repackaged which I really hope isn\u2019t the case. Let down experience.",
"Fast delivery, legit, great product!!!. Bought on Cyber Monday. This 16 inch Mac is aweeeesomeeeee!!! 0.) Expercom is a legit seller with a great price; I saved more than $216. 1.) Shipping: 2 days only, satisfy an impatient guy like me. 2.) Product: Great overall, but the keyboard is not that \"magical\". 3.) I didn't experience any issues... yet, no popping/clicking sounds while playing videos/using apps. Highly recommended product!!! P/s: I heard Apple will release a new Macbook in late 2020 with Mini-LED screen. IMHO, if you're having trouble with the clicking sounds or any issues, you should wait until 2020 to buy a Macbook xD.",
"Form before function. Slim and sleek but it comes at the cost of loud fan noise and thermal throttling. The screen is nice but has ridiculous ghosting. Will probably return and stick with a mac mini for my macOS needs. If you're looking to use this for office work/web browsing then its probably fine. Throw anything heavy at it and it sounds like a mini jet engine and the area above the touch-bar gets worryingly hot. Apple should consider adding a quarter inch in height and adding exhaust fan ports to the sides to allow people to actually take advantage of 8 cores and a 5500 gfx chip rather than getting throttled a few minutes into a game or heavy app usage.",
"Best laptop experience for general/photo/video/music/portable use, but not a performance powerhouse. The new macbooks are the best laptop experience you'll find in the market, but they are far from the strongest performing laptops you'll find, especially for the money. If you want a smooth, streamlined experience, without having to carry a mouse around, the macbook pro 16 and the Mac OS is the cream of the crop. The colors, brightness, and clarity of the laptop are absolutely the best quality screen you'll find in a laptop. The keyboard is great, but a bit overhyped. What it surpasses others in is build quality, there is a lot of quality control in every single key, so they feel stable, consistent, and satisfactory. But to me, they don't make or break a laptop experience. The speakers exceed all of the hype and reviews that you hear. Go to the apple store when you can and give them a listen, they are some of the best portable speakers period. The touchpad is arguably worth the price tag alone if you are looking to carry around your work. It is accurate and enjoyable to use, and far better than anything else on a non Apple product. With all this said, the performance is lackluster at least for my standards. While navigating photo editing apps like Adobe are enjoyable with the trackpad, there is still quite a bit of video lag when panning, zooming, or operating large files. In the OS, windows are laggy to move around from a visual standpoint. For the same price you could get a Windows laptop that has an RTX 2070 or higher, and everything would be much more enjoyable from a snappy and visual standpoint. This is my first macbook, and I absolutely love the user experience it provides. But despite the prestige of owning one, the build quality associated with every part of the laptop, the amazing screen and touchpad, and the portable power consistency you can get when it isn't plugged in, I have to say I'll be moving back to a Windows laptop. The biggest thing I will miss is the touchpad.",
"Something is not right with Apple from Amazon. Very suspicious batch. It is a second Apple laptop we own. First one we got from job almost 6 years ago. Old one performed very well and served us great. It's still running tho, but gets overheated most of the time and now in, times of quarantine, can't really handle Zoom/external screen well and just shots down more and more often due to overheating. So we decided it's time for a new one, also from Apple. So, this one arrived. Looked great, screen was good, Seemed to be working fine untill on the day 2 TWO, when we start noticing overheating issues (we generally use laptop for school needs only like school Web research and Zoom. No gaming, no movies, No video/music additing programs). Temp run to 90-100 degrees. It was so hot, that even touching it was painful. We could probably fry an egg on it. Then we noticed, that Battery Health dropped to 96%. And it's all withing first 5 days of using a brand new laptop. Strange and very alerting, especially for such a reliable product as Apple. We stopped by in Apple store to see how this same laptop performs there on their display, just to compare and see maybe they all created equal, or maybe not. it turned out that the one in the store didn't hit up as much, and we tried to run heavy programs, 4K videos, exttension screen, and to add to it, in the store they keep them up running all day, with no breaks. At the end of the day we buy computer for its functionality but not for look. The one we got from Amazon turned out to be underperforming for us to keep it. We returned it. Maybe it's just a bad batch Amazon got from Apple, that's why it's on sale. Well, it is what it is, Who knows. Returning process was such a pain too. Amazon didn't truck return package right, We had to reefer to UPS tracking to prove the point and they overdue return big time. Still waiting for $$$$. I already contacted them twice so far, will see how many more times I will have to pinch them for my return. But, moving on, we Got a stronger laptop, this time directly from apple official website, with stronger processor and bigger memory storage. Works good so far",
"Might as well get a Desktop, Battery Life subpar. There isn\u2019t anything special about the MacBook. I compared various Windows based laptops and decided on the MacBook because of reputation for longevity and customer satisfaction. The computer itself isn\u2019t any faster processing compared to the Windows ones I looked at but does cost significantly higher. The plus side is the screen resolution seems fine and the camera seems alright. Apple is supposed to be more resistant to getting hacked, which was a big selling point as well. The keyboard seems fine as well although the trackpad is not as nice as some Windows brands I looked at. I have invested in a mouse to offset this so it isn\u2019t a huge deal breaker since laptops have that as a compromise anyway. There are only 4 USB-C ports and a headphone jack for the entire device. Something to be aware of if connections are important. I will likely use two of them at any given time for my purposes and have a dongle accessory to make this better suited for my desires. Having ports would have been nice (especially seeing how much space would be available for ports) but unfortunately, that is how Apple operates. Now for the main negatives: The speakers are not great. Soft and flat regardless of where the volume is at. Let down with that since that was supposed to be a plus. I will end up either using headphones or get additional speakers if I want to listen to audio on a regular basis. To me, it sounds as though the speakers are covered by something thus causing the sound to be much quieter. The battery life is the big disappointment. It took 25% battery to set up the system and perform an update. It lost 6% in sleep mode overnight, and even after fully charging and shutting down the computer, it lost 2% of battery. Within about 1 hour 50 minutes of use after that, 35% battery consumed. I have not been running programs in the background. The only thing I had used it for besides set up (and I did adjust battery settings for optimal use during set up) was to download Open Office and Zoom Meeting. A brief amount of internet time but not multi-tasking anything. Very, very lite use. In sleep mode for about 75 minutes later on to see where the battery was at, there was another 1% battery loss. Another thing I noticed was the top lid had some small paint blister bubbles that quickly started to chip when I slid my finger over to see what it was. $2800 for a laptop with a small battery life and chipped paint is not good business. I contacted support for the brand new computer and it was recommended to exchange this one with another. If the new one is different and performs well with reasonable battery then I will come back and write an update. Maybe I had a \u201clemon\u201d sent to me. I will find out with the second one. Update: After contacting Amazon Customer Service (twice since first service agent didn\u2019t actually process a replacement), I have received a replacement. In spite of the capability to transfer the files from the defective computer to the new one, the two computers would not recognize each other. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have important files to transfer or I would have been upset. So far, the battery is holding on with minimal loss. Significantly better than the first one I received. The paint on this one was smooth as well and no chips or bubbles. I think this is a brand new legit laptop! Just like I ordered. Downloading Open Office was quick and smooth. The defective one took much longer to download/install. Email works fine but I haven\u2019t used the computer for anything yet. Once I get some use to determine the real value, I will update.",
"Defective purchase. Laptop came in sealed box. Upon startup (initial welcome/boot screen) 3/4 of the screen turns black and then crashes and restarts. Never made it to desktop image. Called Apple and was on technical support with them for 40 mins trying everything. They deemed it a hardware failure and recommended a return. I returned to amazon and ordered through Apple directly. Disappointed with this time-sensitive purchase which ended up being defective.",
"Overheating Macbook. Strongly recommend ordering from the website, my macbook overheats with only a few tabs open and fan runs constantly. Even when all applications are closed, the fans are constantly running. I contacted support however they can't seem to assist me in fixing this issue.",
"Always disappointed with Macs. I\u2019m a new graphic designer and wanted to get the best computer to help me with my work and this year\u2019s Mac is pretty much at the top of the list. 1. As always Apple makes you buy accessories for everything. So if you want to hook up a second screen or use a mouse with a receiver, you have to buy another accessory. They advertise the 4 usbc ports as something that\u2019s great, but in reality it\u2019s a pain. 2. It overheats all the time. I\u2019ve had it for about a month and use it for zoom calls and design programs. Absolutely forget about having zoom and chrome open at the same time. The fan goes on blast and everything slows down to compensate. 3. The Touch Bar at the top is pretty useless. I\u2019ve only ever used it to control the volume, but that could\u2019ve been done easily with buttons. You can start and stop zoom calls from it, but it\u2019s not a feature that\u2019s useful on a laptop. Conclusion: it\u2019s just another overpriced apple product. I should have gone with the Acer equivalent, which is in the same price range.",
"Be careful purchasing through amazon!. I will never purchase another apple product from amazon again, I ordered this laptop because I needed one for work ASAP and didn\u2019t have time to wait on Apple to get them in (I ordered mine back in December when they first came out). Now I have the \u201cblack screen of death\u201d and it will not power on! I cannot get any apple support on this product, and i wasted over 2 grand on a laptop that is not even useable. I have never had an issue with ANYTHING from Apple, my iMac, airport base station, phones, iPad, etc. I have also babied this laptop, it has always been kept in a protective case, no spills, nothing whatsoever it is just a glitch &amp; due to me buying it through amazon I am just out of luck. So please beware &amp; I would Definitely recommend if you want this laptop-just go to Apple and purchase AppleCare. Before it just \u201cstopped powering on\u201d it was an awesome laptop, zero issues, it was fast, very useful &amp; I loved it. But now it\u2019s no good.",
"Amazing Build Quality - Sucky Performance. Let's be honest, it's an Apple Macbook, so the build quality is AWESOME!!! But.... For almost $3000 this thing is way under specs. Talk about an Apple Tax!!! If you are doing basic tasks and don't mind paying the high Apple Tax, get it. The screen is terrific. The size of the screen is perfect. The touchpad is the best out there and can't even compare to any other laptop. Speakers sound terrific for small laptop speakers. Keyboard though is meh.... Could be better. Feels to cheap. Webcam? Forget about it. Sucks. Low resolution and low quality. 16gb of ram? For a almost 3000 dollar laptop? Really??? Doing basic stuff it ran warm. Plugged in my samsung 4k monitor and it now runs hot. Really? Can't handle 4K without cooking? Next I realized the 4K was not outputting in HDR. In order to get 4K HDR you need the $70 Apple USB-C dongle. Ok. Fine. Ordered it. Came in same day. Plugged it in. Nice, 4K in HDR. Now it runs a little hotter. Oh. And wait. The display went out on me a couple times. Known issue with the Apple USB-C adapter. Really??? Now comes the best part. Edited a video and began to encode it to MP4 H265. Kicked it off. 2 hour video was going to take a few hours to complete. Really? I9 processor in this mac and my older I5 PC did video editing faster? Now about 2 mins I to video encoding this thing fired up all fans, and got hot enough to cook eggs on it (up by the touchpad). It was so loud I thought it was gonna blow. Needless to say I packed it all back up and returned it to Amazon. Plugged in my I5 8th gen windows PC with 32GB ddr4 ram, samsung evo plus ssd, and 1060 video card and was much happier again. Honestly, it doesn't compare. Last but not least, simple things in the OS like maximizing the window. Did you know you can't maximize easily in macos? Full screen yes but I just want to maximize not full screen the app. Full screen takes over the entire screen. Also, what's the point in having an \"almost\" 4K screen when Apple won't let you watch videos over 1080P in safari, netflix, or Amazon.",
"Very disappointed in the service. Purchased this item for my wife after she got a new job and the battery leaked in the package and was scarred by it on my hand.",
"Limited Features. Apple, in their infinite wisdom (no card readers, hdmi ports, limited USB-c ports, no regular USB ports (which most of my other devices have) no headphone jacks, no forward delete key, etc) has also decided we don't need a touch screen on a laptop? And, try to easily find Zoom for the MacBook Pro! I suppose if I wanted to buy something Apple, it would have to be an iPad. To me, the MacBook Pro isn't worth the super hefty price tag to be missing features and/or programs that I would consider a basic function. They are right about the keyboard though. It is nice to use. Worth an extra $1500 - not really. I'm going to return mine and stick with a PC.",
"Fast and functional. I purchased this laptop as a dual-purpose work/home use computer and so far this laptop has performed better than any previous laptop I've owned, to date. While running parallels it will boot Windows 10 in less than 10 seconds, faster than my HP laptop that only runs windows. This being my fist MacBook computer, most of my frustrations in setting it up have been with the lack of application parity between the iPad and MacBook models, but realizing the two run different operating systems I guess this is to be expected. This laptop is blazing fast to boot up and I haven't had any issues with the video graphics or CPU showing any signs of sluggish operation while running multiple applications at the same time. Very happy with the fit and finish of the hardware, and it appears to be very well built.",
"Outstanding quality, start to finish. -I never had the displeasure of typing on the butterfly keyboard, but this one is nice, very nice. Felt very natural from the moment I unboxed and turned this beast on. -Touch ID. Loving it! Makes accessing 1Password a joy, as well as using Apple Pay. I am sure there are others that I will find as I continue to explore. -Touch Bar. I really didn\u2019t think I would be at all interested in using this feature, but I have found it quite handy. There are some customizable features you can add, but for now, I am continuing to learn what comes \u201cstock\u201d. For those unaware, the Touch Bar is a LED screen that changes, depending on the app you are in, giving what amounts to be shortcuts for various features. It replaces the physical F1-12 keys which can still be brought up. . -It goes without saying that I love the extra large screen, and to me, it is gorgeous! -Battery life has been quite good. The 100W battery (largest allowed by the FFA) is meeting my needs. -The 3 array microphones on the left side. Have not had time to play with it, but it has gotten some good reviews. -The speakers. Six of them. As I said, WOW! Force cancelling woofers keep the annoying vibration at louder playback at bay. How they make the sound appear up to a foot of either side of the laptop is beyond me, but I love it. My last laptop was a 2008 MBP, and it is still functional. Hoping that this will have a similar track record.",
"Do not buy!. I bought this laptop as an addition to the MacBook Pro I\u2019ve had that I got in 2012 and still works great! I purchased this one to use for my work only. I am a part time photographer and only used this work work a handful of times. I kept it in the box, away from everything and in perfect condition. Unfortunately, because I only used it a handful of times, when it suddenly broke I\u2019m left helpless. It isn\u2019t even paid off yet and I\u2019m left with a broken laptop. Amazon customer service\u2019s only \u201chelp\u201d was to say restart it. Then they said sorry, nothing we can do. A company worth billions. Ridiculous. Out of nowhere in the middle of working the screen started flickering and lines started appearing. I turned it off for the night. The next morning the problem continued for a few minutes before the screen went black. I know it\u2019s still on, but there is no screen. Maybe it\u2019s the new operating system that is poor. I never had issues like this with my 2012 MacBook which is still working great.",
"Many things better. a VERY solid and overdue upgrade. Having struggled with \"butterfly keyboard disease\" on my late 2016 15.4\" MacBook Pro, I was excited to learn Apple had eliminated it. When the 16\" models first came out, I learned they'd not only eliminated it, to universal positive opinions, I jumped as soon as I found a significant discount. I learned that other things are better as well: The screen is gorgeous The speakers can deliver LOUD and gloriously undistorted sound, missing only the thunderous base that requires a subwoofer that one cannot cram into an oh-so-thin case. This one was a surprise, because I've not seen it mentioned elsewhere: ever since I got my 2016 model, I've fought to keep the base of my left thumb from producing unwanted mouse clicks on the giant trackpad. The trackpad LOOKS the same, but the almost random cursor jumps are extremely rare now. I'm still struggling a bit because of the mandatory \"upgrade\" to macOS 10.15 Catalina. Some favorite prior software simply has no adequate 64-bit replacements.",
"2015 MacBook Pro is Better. I\u2019m a longtime Mac user, and I was excited to try this new MacBook Pro from the 2015 model. What attracted me to this device was mainly the performance and keyboard; I did not like the 2016-2018 ones. Going from the 2015 model, things were actually worse than the 2015 model. Battery life was shorter; unable to turn on Mac while battery was dead and had to wait for it to charge for a little while; fan noise was loud during normal use with few processes. Overall the 2015 model outperforms this 2019 model, and the 2019 is not doing as it is described. Sometimes... older is better. I will stick with my current MacBook Pro 15 in, which has no issues whatsoever.",
"Great MBP. I have a SONY VAIO for 12 years. It has NEVER given me any problems, and for some time now I've been thinking about trading for an MBP. I wasn't sure about switching my VAIO / W7 because of the criticism I've been reading in recent years about what Apple was doing with its computers and complaints about the keyboard, temperature, slow speed and so on. Glad to have waited because this MBP is amazing. I really hope that this model doesn't show any issues as the previous ones.",
"Amazon Sent Me a Defective Product. My new MacBook had several issues from day one. Advised with several technicians and Apple themselves. They all told me I had a lemon. Amazon refused to replace this defective product that I spent over $2k on. Absolutely ridiculous.",
"This new Mac is not compatible with major aps and virtually unusable!. There was no mention on description that indicated this new model could not use the application software I use. Also the software description like Photoshop Essentials cannot run on this 64 bit computer. The laptop is actually unusable because of the software issues. There is no conversion dates for the major software used. I am very disappointed!",
"Their best MacBook to date. My unit has no overheating issues, no loud fan noise (I cannot heat fans at all when doing the usual office stuff), no screen issues. It is very snappy, the screen is very nice. When reading the negative reviews here, make sure to ignore those from unverified purchases who simply hate on Apple. Apple tarnished his record somewhat in recent years with problematic releases. However they delivered everything on this specific model. It feels very refined and a pleasure to work on. Just like they did an awesome job on their new iPhone SE2. If you have an iPhone, this machine will integrate nicely with it. There are many deserving windows laptops out there. A lot to choose from, which is great for all of us. I prefer doing my work on a Mac, and Mac OS. It fits like a tailored glove, and once you\u2019ve experienced that; it\u2019s hard to come back to windows no matter which laptop. And I\u2019ve tried probably close to virtually all of them. If in doubt, buy this Mac; give it a test drive. Return if you don\u2019t like it. But something tells me you will enjoy it very much. ;-)",
"Wouldn\u2019t recommend. Overheats. Long response times. Etc.. Machine kept over heating and losing internet. Turned off Bluetooth in order to help internet connection as many blogs stated to do this, however did not help. Long wait times for every app opened, and waiting for logon screen to appear after sleeping computer. Overall not impressed. Would not recommend. And then got ripped off when trying to return product as they took $350 from the $2499 price tag I paid.",
"Overcharged and kept my money and computer. Amazon overcharged me for this computer, so I canceled it and bought another of the same at correct price. 2 weeks later I got the canceled one and sent it back unopened and they have kept over $4,000 of my money because they messed up the serial numbers. They re wives my return but never told me and kept my money for both and admitted this to me! Nothing is worth this stress of being stolen from like this",
"A Good Laptop, But Not What It Used To Be For The Price. My first laptop was the 2012 Retina Display MacBook Pro. I LOVED that thing. I am a student in theoretical physics, and need a computer that is up to long hours of heavy computation. The old mac has lasted me 8 years now, but its screen is now telling me it is time to retire the machine (it will cost a lot to replace). I enjoy Mac software as well, and the terminal application. So I got this new MacBook Pro as a replacement. I did have very high hopes for it, and was excited to see what 8 years of development has brought to the table. To be frank: 8 years has not brought all that much, at least from what I can notice with my daily computer activities (which include running/producing code, connecting to high performance computing clusters, writing papers, surfing the web), so my expectations were not met. I will say the screen is very sharp, more so than my previous computer. There is also a touch bar. The old macs have buttons rather than the touch bar. I am getting used to this, and am deciding I like this feature. The mouse pad though does not feel as good as the older version, despite being larger. It had a weird double click feel every time I press down. It feels cheaper than the older macs. It seems Mac has run away with trying to be intuitive to the user. They have gone so much so in this direction, that it is almost difficult to find/do what one would think are simple functions. It isn't as fast as I would have hoped either (seems about as fast as my old computer!). This was disappointing. The battery seems to last a while, which is good (5/5 for the battery). Overall it is a good computer. I do like my Mac, and it gets done what I want it to. However, is it worth the near $2500-3000 price tag? Probably not quite, although I did have very high expectations for what that $2.5-3K would get me. I paid that much for the 2012 Mac, which was DEFINITELY worth the price for everything it had and came with! This one was just a small step from that computer, yet charges the same amount. I would have wanted slightly better quality and more development for the amount I paid. I hope this computer, like its younger sibling that I now retired, will have a long and computationally productive life. If it lasts as long, it would be worth the price tag. I also have yet to fully utilize its 8-core processor, which I am excited to do.",
"Thermal Throttling turns a fast i9 machine to something from 10yrs ago. So if you video edit render Resolve / Premiere 4k files, PASS PASS PASS!!! It starts at a fast 38fps on my renders, then ultimately renders at 11fps, like an old SLOW computer. I tested it outside in the cold last night, and surprise it rendered over 1 hour project at 38fps, because the frigid air 35F kept it cold, just as it was finishing I took it back inside a normal 70F house, and as it warmed to the inside air the fps dropped back down to 11fps, because Apple did not make this thing to work more then for quick use of the i9/i7 cores. Sad, it can do some wonderful things on the playback side of heavy lifting, but hit the cores hard for more than 5 minutes, and it ucks. Hoping the new Silicone M1 Macs can handle the heat better",
"Buy this computer. If you\u2019re debating a pro machine for a long term investment, this is the laptop to look at. Seriously, the minor improvements over previous models are game changing. TLDR, simply the best computer for the price, especially with all the free apps MacOS gives you that would cost about $400 in total in Windows. (Obviously if you already own office/Adobe software not a factor for you). My favorite thing switching to macOS next to the smoothest gesture interface ever is never having to worry if I need to download some bloated freeware to extract or view a file. Boot camp, faster Solidworks performance than my custom desktop with dedicated GPU. Buy the +$300 option. Excellent deal, you will notice 8 cores if you do professional work (cad, editing, vfx, etc) and the 1Tb SSD leaves plenty of space for a comfortable Windows partition. Faster graphics is a plus too. Get yourself some fan control software, there are plenty of free/cheap options out there, and it can easily cool itself at 100% fans unlike some other MacBooks. You don\u2019t even notice they are on if like me you do a lot of work in public areas. (Apple\u2019s stock drivers prioritize noise reduction, which is nice 90% of the time, but toggle max fans is a must have for any thin/light laptop these days, not just MacBooks. Thermal improvements aside, the speakers will blow you away. Even if you have expensive dedicated drivers, you will still find yourself just using these often. They are just that good. I was hyped from reviews and still a few weeks later I\u2019m just in love every time I play music with high dynamic range (I\u2019m a huge piano lover, and literally no ordinary speakers can render piano well) Keyboard, excellent. You may need a few days to adjust, but I find I can fly through memorized lines of code after a bit of practice. They feel enjoyable to type on, and are honestly a bit addictive, which is a weird thing to say about a keyboard, but there. The backlight is soft but very visible, without the horrendous bleeding like on my Lenovo laptop. Battery. Ok, best you\u2019re going to get in a 6+ core machine this capable, and still take it on a plane. The screen is very bright, but with the reflector you can really save on battery if you reduce brightness to ~80%. The 95 watt charger is very fast though, so if you do run out, you don\u2019t have to wait long. Lastly the screen. I say this to everyone who I consult about screens, but stats are deceptive. This is the best looking screen I\u2019ve seen bar none, certainly on a laptop. Apple really knows how to make a display, and I\u2019d take this screen over a \u20184K\u2019 Dell any day. Honestly don\u2019t pay attention to Apple hate. I get it, people have opinions, but seriously, your machine, you have to use it. To conclude, while you can find other laptops that do one or two things as good or better than this one, the 2019 MacBook Pro 16\u201d is the most well rounded computer I\u2019ve come across. Everything just works, and boy does it work well. It will last you 6+ years, and you\u2019ll enjoy the whole life of this machine.",
"Wont run my High Sierra Programs. Returned the Laptop after it would not run on any OS before 10.15 and all my programs become expensive subscription services that are over priced and under valued for my business needs. Nothing attaches to the machine. You have to buy all kids of dongles or docks that hang off the machine in order to use any external drives, printers, SSD cards. Touch bar is a waste of upgrade for apple. You will never use the touch bar that is taking up real estate and increasing the price. You work on the keyboard and look at the screen not the touch bar. Better off buying a last Gen Mac pre touch bar. I have bought 2 pre touch bar machines and much happier.",
"A GOOD PRODUCT. My old Mac Book Pro had serious problems trying to run Catilana. So I threw in the towel and bought this new one. The PC works very well. Catinlina has problems, like loosing files and is somewhat unstable. I have hard drive which Catalina will not format with the new system. If I go bak to my old Mac I can reformat it and then it will work with Catalina. Jobs would never have let this sloppy programing out the door. Best suggestion is back up often. Because you may loose file any time.",
"The Best Macbook Pro In A Long Time!. There are extremely lengthy reviews here if you want specifics on why this device is great. I'll keep my review rather short and address 3 areas that make this a great unit! I should state that I have had the 2019 Macbook Pro 13, 2015 Macbook Pro 13, and 2012 Macbook Pro 15.4 to use as a reference to why this unit is so great! First: Quality! This thing is absolutely beautiful to look at! I know I know all MacBooks look the same but these units with the space grey just look so different. They have a darker hue and a much more inviting presence than the previous models that were limited to the lighter grey colour. Additionally, the cool touch of the aluminum just sparks something within you wanting to be creative. That is likely from the very convincing marketing done by apple; nonetheless, it is a thing. The \"good\" keys are back as well! The 2019 Macbook pro 13 that I owned had those new butterfly switch keys that were uncomfortable after extended use. The keys on this MacBook have the same functionality as the 2012 model but with more precision. Second: Hardware! This is a step up for Macbooks! Yes, you can purchase all these items individually and make a pc but honestly, you wouldn't be saving so much at current prices. Like with everything in tech, time is the death of all luxuries. One day the most expensive unit, the next day the median. This unit has enough capability to keep up with anyone trying to do general work and then some. I personally use this laptop for law school and work. My work requires me to use multiple screens and have multiple applications running at the same time. This MacBook pro can handle all that and then some without overheating, something that cannot be said about the 2019 and 2015 Macbook pro 13in. Third: The Screen and Sound! While I mostly use this for school and work, it is great to have an amazing screen and set of speakers to watch movies and youtube videos on as well. The screen is fantastic and the sound is equally amazing. I think most speakers in MacBooks are lacking, however, in this model, the speakers provide a fantastic quality of sound. The sound is rich and provides depth to your music and videos. The screen compliments the sound by providing you that accuracy to detail. While the screen does not provide 4k, the quality is unmatched to any other screen I've seen on a laptop, that is including other Macbooks and PCs. This is simply a great machine. I'm not sure if this review was able to answer all your questions but at least I was able to provide my perspective on why I love this machine! Well worth the investment for anyone looking for a system designed for ease, longevity, and style.",
"Great machine if you don\u2019t use the touch bar.. Almost everything is great about this machine: the thermal is great compared to previous 15\u201d model, the speaker is breathtaking, the screen is gorgeous, the build is solid, the keyboard is reliable, but the touch bar makes me want to throw this great machine to the wall on multiple occasions when I absolutely need to use it. This will be my last Macbook Pro as long as the touch bar exists.",
"Heats up badly. Heats up badly, can't put it on lap",
"Mac book pro return. Wow. Do not purchase electronics from Amazon. Ordered a MacPro, it wasn\u2019t what I expected. Returned it and have tried twice to get my refund (Amazon got the Mac back a week ago)! Customer Service promised refund by yesterday (7/23/20) and that this would be \u201cprioritized\u201d. Still no refund. That\u2019s a TON OF MONEY! so disappointed.",
"love love my Late 2019 1T 16G Ram LAPTOP. THE keyboard is amazing but Macbook Pros are the best they last 10 years so you better get you one. Leave Windows in the dust. we had a Laptop version of Surface A JOKE! They run all those commercials bc they HAVE TOO. THE TOUCH SCREEN IS OVER RATED ON SURFACE... I LOVE APPLE EVERYTHING. LOL ALTHOUGH I HAVE SAMSUNG 10 PHONE... WHY I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON? GOT IT IN 4 DAYS ON PRIME, BUT EVERYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A WEEK OR SO WAIT OR YOU HAD TO PAY EXTRA. THX AMAZON",
"DOA. Super disappointed in this whole experience. Not only did this machine not work when I went to set it up, but Amazon really gave me the runaround, insisting that we call Apple Support to get THEM to fix a \"refurb\" machine that arrived barely functioning. 3 hours later the result was the same: return it to Amazon and find a new computer to buy. NEVER AGAIN will I buy anything refurbished by Amazon. Apple should be PISSED.",
"DO NOT BUY. Warning!!! Do not buy this $2K laptop from Amazon. I had just received it and it doesn\u2019t even work. Blank screen with a folder picture blinking. Waste of money and time. They don\u2019t even offer insurance AppleCare. Returning this immediately",
"A Return to Form. Finally a macbook with the pleasant writing experience again. I stopped buying macs after my 2012 MBP retina purchase, because of the butterfly keys fiasco(2015-2019). Overall, a really great laptop. Love that they bumped the screen size to 16 inches while keeping almost the same form factor (by thinning the bezels). Note: this maybe the last macbook pro 16 inch with Intel processors, from 2020 on Apple announced they will use their own ARM based processors which doesn't use x86-64 instruction sets. In short, you can't use Parallels desktop nor bootcamp on future macbook models. Grab emm' while they are still Intel based.",
"It's \"OK\" for a Mac... Not Perfect.... I've been a Mac user for around 25 years, so I know Apple pretty well. This laptop is nice. It runs efficiently, doesn't get too hot, but the battery life is BY FAR not what they claim it to be. Also \u2014 my biggest complaint \u2014 is that the built-in video camera SUCKS big time. I was sorely disappointed when I switched from my \"ancient\" 2013 MacBook Pro, which had a pretty decent camera, over to this new one, only to find that the camera resolution was horrendous. I had to buy an external camera for video calls with my clients... it's THAT bad! Everything else seems to be high-quality Apple-ness, as expected.",
"Nice Apple Laptop But.... If you're in the market for a new Apple laptop that has top performance go for the i9 with 8-cores. This 6-core is good but not great. I had the older version before this one and honestly the improvements are minuscule. Definitely not worth the extra hundreds of dollars. I video edit a lot and that's where the minimum improvements show up the most with the 6-core i7. I'm a little disappointed with how much I paid versus the 'improvements' has made. Get the i9 8-core if you can afford it.",
"Great computer, comes loaded with gawd-awful Catalina OS.. This computer is top of the line at a good \"Apple\" price...which is much more than you will pay for a Windows 10 machine. If you do not know what the features are, you should look them up first before coming here. The part YOU SHOULD KNOW is that the machine comes loaded with Apple's Catalina OS. Sooooooooo bad.! This OS is worse than the old Windows Vista OS...hard as that is to believe. Bugs, bugs, bugs with different ways of accessing known features for no good reasons. Some applications do not work as they used to. Some go off and inexplicably open up other applications and webpages. Itunes has now become MUSIC which occasionally will not open your music library. Apple software engineers took a good OS (Mojave) and turned it into a very annoying, frustrating piece of bad software. If you want to find out how to do something on a Mac, dont research it online, because what is said will many times not hold true in Catalina. Why fix it if it aint broke? Mojave was not broke. Catalina is. Very soon, Apple will be pushing OS Big Sur. Oh wow!! Will this be a horrid extension of Catalina? Who knows. Im not going to find out. I am quite sorry that I bought this machine only because I had no choice of OS.",
"Battery life percentage fades in front of your eyes. Purchased this item on Amazon since it had a good pricing compared to other outlets. Ordered this beefed up i9 model since I thought I would use it for long time so why not spend extra few hundred bucks more than base model. Turns out this i9 processor is very powerful and consumes a lot of energy. Since I do not work on anything that requires that much processing power I've decided to return this in favor of a base model which is cheaper and i7 therefore uses less energy. I could literally notice that battery percentage was ticking down which rarely happens on a new and expensive laptop.",
"100% not worth the money. For the outrageous price you have to pay for this, it is not at all worth the money. The I9 cannot work as fast as it should with limited cooling in this laptop. The screen is ok but battery life is horrible and the computer is way too slow for what it should be. Save yourself the time and money and just build your own for much less money and make it more reliable. Oh and mine came damaged in the mail, bunch of scratches on the cover. Don\u2019t buy a computer from amazon, second hand BS.",
"NO USB ports. You can tell Steve Jobs is long gone from Apple. Why did Apple decide to not have at least one USB port? This means I now have to buy a new wireless (bluetooth or USB-C) mouse and a USB to Thunderbolt3 adapter so all of my other USB devices can work. I also have to buy a new portable hard drive since Time machine wants to reformat my entire drive on my current portable drive in order to be compatible with the new Time Machine format. I can't do that since I have a lot of other data on it. Also, there is no longer a magnetic charging port but instead now also uses a Thunderbolt 3 which is not as elegant and will likely break over time. Definitely 2 steps backwards. I haven't even gotten to see if it overheats since I haven't made it to the store to buy the new portable to transfer my data to the new machine. Seriously thinking of sending this thing back.",
"The item arrived damaged. The item arrived damaged, screen was shatterred and won\u2019t turn on!",
"buy directly from Mac!. It doesn\u2019t charge! Called Apple, they want me to buy a new charger for 98 when I can get it on Amazon for 39! Even though the 2100 laptop is still under warrantee. NOT GOOD! this computer had to be completely rebuilt by Mac. Then I realized it didn\u2019t come in the official Mac protective box. Buy directly from Mac!",
"defective MAC. I get defective MAC. it keeps rebooting. I need to return this product.",
"Overall okay product. Well made computer Best specs No much innovation from the 15 MacBook Pro that I Have. Honestly you can save a lot of money buying 15 version instead of 16",
"Don\u2019t buy here. Sent a broken seal mac and seems to be buggy!",
"Superior build quality, superior performance, superior sound. Simply superior.. Apple did a great job with this machine. The quality and performance are amazing. I'd purchased a high-spec Windows-based machine to give Win10 a try but the streaming ads in my workspace and the overall clutter simply were not worth the marginally 'lower' price. This new Macbook Pro delivers value and performance, which in turn gives me the power to do the same with my work.",
"I love everything about the MacBook. I can't believe I waited this long to make the switch from a windows machine to a MacBook. I've been a photographer for weddings/senior portraits for over 10 years, and I should have bought one of these 10 years ago! The screen is AMAZING. 6 out of 5 stars!! The colors of the display, the crispness.... it's just flat out spectacular. If you're considering this as a change/upgrade from any other type of display, do it!!! This is a great laptop for photographers and the main reason I bought it. Again, I've been a windows user forever, and I didn't want to stray from that because I've always been mostly happy. My other laptop (Acer Nitro 17\") has been great and was used flawlessly for 6 years for my photo editing, but when I got this in my hands, I couldn't believe how much better it looked for photo editing. Not to mention some of the other things I was missing out on.... like the bluetooth connection to my iPhone. So now when I'm editing photos, I can get messages and reply on a full keyboard with the messages app on the computer. I will be honest, I am not a super-user, 90% of my time on the MacBook is in Photoshop. I still use the windows machine for other activities, and I'm slowly making the transition to the MacBook. I would have to say that there are adjustments, like not having an optical drive, and having to order USB-C connections for external monitors, and no card reader on the laptop, but those are minor and I knew this would be an issue in making the switch so I won't be negative about that in this review. Battery life is great. I get about 6 solid hours with Pandora on and heavy edits in Photoshop. I haven't really gone longer than that, but it seems to hold up well. I love the design, the keyboard is sweet, the power block is not the best being as large as it is, but I just keep it plugged in under my desk and really don't use it around the house since the battery life is quite good. I really cant say a lot about technical specs versus cost, I'm sure that's been covered in other reviews. I can only sing praises to this because of the display and battery life so far. If you're a photographer (or do any other sort of graphic design or image editing) this is a must have. I really can't believe I lived this long without one.",
"Wrong refund. You are refunding the MacBook Air not the MacBook Pro. Computer was not what was described.",
"Great for Video Editing in Adobe Premier Pro.. I do a lot of video editing. I had been using an i7 Windows Desktop gaming PC/48Gig RAM. I was getting fed up with constant Windows Updates and things that stopped working in the middle of editing because something was updating in the background. It always seems to required a restart before Premier would work again. I have only had this MAC a short time but I am very impressed by its performance. Videos are rendering fast and the 16GIG of ram has not been an issue at all. Its a bit pricey for the specs but the OS seems so much better at handling the processing than my Windows PC did.",
"I love my Mac! I loved my old Mac! You can't go wrong with Mac!. I love my first Mac. It was a MacBook Pro from 2011. It was so awesome! Heck, who am I kidding? It still is! I still think it's a great machine, so why did I buy a new Mac, well, Apple has advanced in their tech over that last 9 years. So much so that if I wanted to continue to develop iOS apps, I needed to get a new Mac so that I could get the latest versions of Xcode. Yes, I was a bit upset at first because I had already upgraded my old Mac with more memory and storage, and even put in a solid state drive, so spec-wise, it was pretty decent, but boy was I happy when I received my new Mac. I had already had a 2019 Mac at work, but it was my work machine, not my personal one. I was pleasantly surprised by the additional benefits that I had when I used my personal account on this new 16\" MacBook Pro of my very own. Once again Apple has impressed me with the little things. The small details like when my Apple Watch unlocks the Mac for me, or how it seems to work so well with all of my notifications and messages. I hate to quote this because it's become so cliche, but, \"It just works!\" There, I said it. All of this being said, I will say that when anyone asks me if they should buy a Mac, I will say, \"Yes\", BUT I would not say everyone needs a MacBook Pro. My wife had the same MacBook Pro 2011 as me, but when it came time to upgrade, she chose to get a new iPad Pro. It does everything she needs, and is perfect for her. She likes to browse the internet, do internet banking, and do some light photography editing. My boys do their homeschool work on MacBook Airs. So there are many options out there, and the bottom end is gaining in speed and power. If you really must work on programming or video editing of any sort, I highly recommend a MacBook Pro. Seriously, it's the best way to go. I know that I love mine, and when it's not supported anymore, I will buy another. Also, there aren't a lot of computers from 2011 that are still worth much. I never had a middle-tier PC that lasted as long as the Macs that I've purchased. Mileage may vary, but these are very well built, and keep their value.",
"MacbookPro 16\" 1-love the color. This is NOT the NEW Macbook Pro, it IS the 2019 version. The first article I read about it said it was the NEWEST M1, 16\" and that isn't even out yet. I have never seen anything so hard to use. my sign in name comes up to use it, but will not connect for the cloud and apple store. I cannot download the 20 HOUR NEW OS, it failed, as has everything else I have tried to to download. NO trouble in my Windows PC. sigh Today I got the Thunderbolt Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and the plug doesn't have ANYTHING I have it has some kid of casing on it that doesn't come off. If I don't touch it for 15 seconds, it shuts off and I have to sign in again. Finding ANYTHING in it is a bear with saber tooth tiger teeth! And the beautiful clear keys I had on the first macbook years ago, are gone for black ugly ones. I wanted the NEW macbook pro 16, the fast best laptop they have made to date, but I am sure this will do, just to get out of WINDOWS online for good, to get online with, to order with, etc. I can deal with this, everything else is the PITS, beginning with practically a paper thin notebook. Call me, pardon my FRENCH, pissed. The specs says it comes with Big Sur OS but it has Catalina..so what else is different from the specs? Feeling less than confident in Apple. I cannot find how to change how long the desktop stay active, every way I word it, says no such thing. Good GRIEF. The only real help is from youtube!, and so far even those are lacking. I tried to say what all is wrong with this but something kicked me out of the screen and I lost it all..I am returning this, and if you have had windows for a long time and want control of what and how you do something, stick with it. I can't even get a call to get THROUGH to apple to fix my messed up account. They sent a link to another email address to change my pw! The have NO account with my name and info, but id and pw is working on the computer itself after DAYS of working at it. I AM DONE with apple. Many people love it, many told me POS... for me, it IS POS.",
"Computer broke and it hasn't even been 3 months.. It shutdown twice unexpectedly and the two USB-C ports on the right don't charge with the adapter or work with the dongle. On Apple chat now and on my way to the Genius bar. Think twice because this one has problems.",
"I put in for a return on this Mac, I didn't like the wait time and it was not ever delivered to me.. I had to order another Mac from Apple and that went bad to, So I tried Apple again and got my mac two weeks later.",
"I was unfortunate and received a unit with problems. Before starting doing any programming or data processing, I was using the machine first couple of days only for browsing and checking email and the battery would last 2-3 hours. People told me to switch to Safari for browsing but noway. After a session with Apple specialist, he recommended taking it to the Apple store to be examined.",
"unknown noise from the system. I am not sure where the noise was from when large data access is carried out by the computer. Sounds like old HDD noise, but the system runs on SSD. Frustrated!",
"I like it but.... I don't like it's the huge touch pad but tiny keyboard. I don't use the touh pad and I turned it off... so there's all that wasted space. Mac should give the user a choice of touch pad or larger keyboard. I also miss the number pad. I loved the way it paired up to my desktop computer. I also had to buy a hub to connect most of my accessories: thumb drives, headphones, etc The ports are that small size. My biggest problem with it and I've given it a month's trial, is that there is no backspace. What, with all the front being touchpad they had to reduce the keyboard. I'm an author and need a backspace. I should have to use a special key combination to use it either. Very disappointed. I bought it for writing!!!!",
"High quality, but.... I purchased this laptop after months of researching a replacement for my 2011 13\" MacBook Pro. Having used it daily for almost 10 years, it became apparent that I needed a replacement. Because I never had any issues with it and it held up beautifully after so long, I wanted to invest in another MBP that would give me just as many years. The display is beautiful - one of my favorite features. The speakers sound incredible, especially playing music or sounds with bass. It's much faster and doesn't heat up like my old one did running basic apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, Chrome, etc. The battery is also satisfactory to my expectations. The touchbar is gimicky - I wish I purchased a model without it. To me, it's one too many steps to adjust the brightness or volume. Also, the laptop is almost too thin for my liking. I liked that my older model, while thin, still had some structure to it. I may simply need more time to adjust, but after three months, I still feel like it wouldn't survive a small accident. I purchased dongles separately to allow for USB compatibility; to me it's not a big deal having to use them. I do miss the different ports (SD card slot, ethernet, etc.) that were ready-to-use, no dongles required. Forget gaming - I ran a few games on Steam with disappointing results even after tweaking graphics. It became incredibly hot to the point I became concerned and ceased trying. Also, don't expect to upgrade your own parts. You get what you purchase - memory and storage are soldered in permanently. I think that will be a shortfall for me in the next 5 years when I want to upgrade some parts like I could easily do with my 2011 model as needed. Overall, these are expensive machines BUT pay off in the long run if you take care of it. I remember painfully shelling out the money 10 years ago for my first MBP, but I had no regrets. So far, none on this purchase either unless the inability to upgrade parts proves to be an issue down the road.",
"Stopped working in 56 days, Amazon would not support. The screen no longer worked within 60 days. Amazon only allows a return within 30 days. Amazon did not provide any technical support - even though it says specifically on the product listing that Amazon technical support is provided for up to 60 days. This was not true. The only option was to return and pay a fee or deal directly with Apple. My advice is to never purchase an Apple product through Amazon and deal with Apple directly.",
"It just works!. I love the simpler operating system/GUI. MacOS is easy to use and learn. Windows, on the other hand, gets more complicated and unwieldy with every release. That's not to say that a Mac is universally better than a Windows-powered PC. I've grown up with DOS and Windows but, after using a Mac for the first time at work for the past six months, I prefer Mac. The MacBook Pro hardware is superior to any PC I've ever used, and that includes my DELL Precision M4800, which is a nice workstation PC laptop. MacOS is cleaner than Windows and less complicated. The Retina display is amazing! The MacBook runs more smoothly for everything I've done, and many peripheral connectivity issues I've had with Windows have disappeared with the MacOS. For example, I have a nice Pioneer portable speaker that acts as a Wi-Fi (not Bluetooth) accessible speaker on my local network. I could not get it to reliably connect in any version of Windows since Windows 7. However, as soon as I got the Mac set up and ready to go, AirPlay found the Pioneer speaker on my network and suggested I use it. It just worked. And it works reliably. To use it with Windows I have been forced to connect it with a cable. Of course, the Mac experience in general is intended to be clean, and that means no cables and wires, or at least as few as possible and practical. I'm thrilled. The MacBook Pro is the best computer upgrade decision I have ever made.",
"Solid upgrade. I was looking to upgrade from my 13\" MacBook air. I was so tired of trying to be productive on such a tiny screen. I frequently run Lightroom and Photoshop at the same time and have several other programs open running in the background and it never falters or pauses for a second. I don't do any video rendering so this machine is a slight overkill for my use, but I was willing to pay for the larger screen size. And this is my first experience with owning a computer with retina and now I'm spoiled for life. I wouldn't want anything else. It's a beautiful display with wonderful colors. Since I'm frequently editing pictures on this computer, I have to calibrate but I find with this display I don't have to be as on top of my calibration as I have with computers in the past. I love the larger track pad. It doesn't get in the way which was a worry. I don't really use the Touch Bar so it's nether in the way or a necessity. As others have said, the speakers are exceptionally wonderful for a laptop. Not a necessity for me, but I still love that they can get so loud when I'm on a zoom call - my 13\" MacBook air speakers left a lot to be desired and it was hard to hear people on a call. I also find that I love typing on the keyboard. Overall I just love the computer. It is a bit on the heavy side, but I don't mind as I don't travel very often with it.",
"Came damaged. This came damaged on the left side of the lid and on the hinge on the bottom of the laptop. I was very careful when opening the packaging and laptop. I don\u2019t believe this is new, I think it\u2019s refurbished.",
"Great keyboard. I personally liked the previous generation keyboard, although the durability issues were concerning. They seemed to have fixed the problem, but who knows. I figured it would take some getting used to the new keyboard, but it was instantly amazing. Really good keyboard. The rest of the computer is no slouch either, but if you\u2019re not looking for a Mac already, nothing I say will change your mind.",
"Replacement for my desktop Mac. What a machine ! I have been a Mac convert for 1o+ years. This MacBook Pro 16 is incredible. I have purchased it to replace my aging 27 inch Mac. No regrets, the screen resolution is exceptional, the speed is blazing and with a 1TB drive, storage is not an issue. I am retired, do a lot of out door photography and this is my go to editing machine. I would buy again and recommend to family without reservation.",
"notebook is overheating. Worst notebook I've ever had, I can't do anything, is overheating all the time. The actual price should be 200$ not 2000. I don't know what to do with this trash now.",
"Excellent machine - but screen door fragile and thin. Be careful with the screen. It's not sufficiently supported by a sturdy metal frame as with previous MacBooks. It WILL break! Was skeptical about the touch bar but it is a great feature to have! Had to spend another $120 on a set of various adapters since this model ONLY offers Firebolt 3 ports. Battery life great. SSD speeds awesome. USB data transfer rate seems doubled on this one.",
"Best Macbook I have ever owned.. This is the fracking best, fastest, most visually appealing and exciting apple product I have bought so far. I sold my iMac 21\" and my 2016 13.3\" MacBook Pro. I didn't have any issues with the other products other than that I definitely needed an upgrade, as I am a photographer and needed something a bit speedier with more storage. For the price, you definitely get what you pay for. I was hesitant buying off of amazon but I feel like I got this straight from apple since I got the same experience. The keyboard feels like a dream, and the screen is the perfect size I do not feel like I'll need an iMac ever again- I needed something reliable that I could also travel with. Note: I did purchase the i9 core and 1TB storage! (highest model) MY ONLY COMPLAINT: The amazon driver set this package on the doorstep, didn't even require a signature. He just LEFT IT on my doorstep. Thank god I was home at time of delivery otherwise I would have risked a $2,600 package being stolen. That's why I gave this 4 stars, otherwise I would've gave it 5. Lightroom and Photoshop installed easily and smoothly without any issues, and it's all set up within one hour.",
"Didn't work right out of the box.... Buy from Apple. Froze when trying to transfer data, now is in kernel panic.",
"Very Good Product. Expensive but worth it.. This is the best MBP yet! Very Powerful Product and I think it is faster than what they are advertising. I can't make this 8 core crash yet? Well worth the 2500.00 I paid for this product and I have no regrets buying it so far. I recommend the new i-9 processor to anyone. 8 core Laptop. can't wait until the new Laptop stuff rivals the new cheesgrator Mac. I can't imagine a 28 core Laptop but it will happen and soon. The speakers are unrivaled for a new laptop. Everything is great. Scalability is also great with this product. You buy it with 16 GB of ram but you can upgrade it to 64 GB DDR4 Ram, and you can also put up to an 8 TB NVM Express SSD in the mix. Too much excitement for me to list. THIS IS PROCESSING POWER AT IT's BEST!",
"Do not believe you are getting a new state of the art computer.. Setup has not been the easiest. No screen available from the old laptop. I believed I was getting a new state of the art Macbook Pro but actually received a 2019 version and probably all the problems associated with that model. Its like buying a 2020 automobile and finding out it is actually a 2019. Not exactly an honest approach from my particular point of view. I paid for 2020 but got something less than that...",
"Good option. New and running like a champ. Battery life is ok when not using integrated AMD graphics but once you do 5 hrs is exactly what you can expect/ 8-10 on intel graphics. Still fantastic setup, would be great if Apple allows for under-clocking to fix the issue with system getting too hot under loads.",
"Buyer beware. Be careful when you purchase this product.Word or office products do not come with this product at this price and add 249.00 to the purchase price",
"Get it if you want/need bootcamp otherwise wait.. Pros: Decent amount of power for gaming in bootcamp. Overall great laptop, love the new/old keyboard. Touch ID is great (now if I could only have that on my iPhone...). The Touch Bar looks great but I rarely use it, it would be better if it had more powerful customization. I love the huge trackpad, hands down the best trackpad on any laptop. Screen looks gorgeous, excellent color, very bright and good contrast. Cons: The screen is a fingerprint magnet and super delicate, and because of the tight tolerances the keyboard and trackpad always touch the screen and any oil from my fingers gets transferred to the screen making it impossible to keep it clean. The fans run constantly on any serious load like gaming or video editing. And of course the standard Apple cons of: fixed battery/RAM/SSD which suck but at the end of the day I'm still Apple's B*****h.",
"Brilliant Machine. Needless to say it's another brilliantly designed machine from Apple. Things that stood out for me particularly in this model: 1. Its body dimensions are almost the same as of previous 15\" model. With thinner bezels, its able to pack a 16\" screen. 2. Sound from the in-built speakers is a major step up from the previous generation. It is incredible how it cancels out vibrations from the woofers, giving you rich deep output, but surprisingly no vibrations in the laptop body. 3. Awesome new (actually old) MacBook keyboard :-)",
"Real or Fake?. I bought this 16 inch MacBook Pro from Amazon dealer and not a third party international seller. Most things work well and I haven't had any problems after two weeks. EXCEPT the bluetooth isn't working. Other than that the computer works well, but still have doubts about it being and authentic Apple product. Also, when applying for Apple Care+ the serial number was not eligible, which lead me to believe it may not be authentic.",
"Macbook, not as good as it once was. At a point of having to dangle plenty of attachments to get the usability I need. I understand the average college kid loves the sleekness and cool factor of no ports, no holes, no luxuries. But, in the real world, I need additional screens, faster ethernet connections, the ability to read a memory cars, etc... I think the pro version should still have some usable ports/features without me having to dangle 4 other things off the side and travel with a grab-bag of add-ons. leave the portless model to the kids in the non-pro line. Also, in travel computers, hard drive space is still a factor.",
"Computer keeps shutting off on its own. Attempted to contact Amazon, no help. Contacted AAPL, have to wait 3 weeks to see me. Computer shuts off on its own.",
"Go directly to apple, not worth the cheaper price on already expensive. Unboxed and a different size laptop was in the box! The box seemed a little beat up but didn\u2019t think anything if it and Frustrating due to needs for a new computer next time I should\u2019ve just went directly her to the Apple Store.",
"Great Experience After All!. &nbsp;Hello Folks, B like U here! After 7 days I finally received my MacBook Pro 16'' Entry Level. Although it was a bit disappointing to find out that no air cushions were used during transportation, I was relieved to receive the product in perfect conditions. Bought it with the Amazon Prime Credit Card and got a great deal compared to those being sold at apple stores. If you want to save some money and delivery time is not an issue then, this is the place to buy it. Looking forward to trying out all my music softwares and testing how powerful this is.",
"Battery didn't hold a charge. I received this product and the battery held a charge for less than 3 hours. Was on with Apple Care service for over an hour to run various tests and fixed, which improved the battery life for up to only 6 hours. Requested a replacement from Amazon, which I received promptly, and it had the same problem. Went through the process again, and ultimately decided to return and cancel the order. Then, the refund took about one month! When I finally got through to Amazon customer service, the attendant was very helpful, but overall this experience was quite frustrating. Would not recommend buying an expensive device from Amazon.",
"Awesome Laptop!. What a phenomenal product. I would buy this laptop over again in a heartbeat. I have to say that it is well worth the money and if I had known how happy I would have been with it I probably would have added more SSD space. What I have works well but I could have cut out the need for some external hdd if I had upgraded a bit. I would recommend this to anyone in the market and considering a MacBook.",
"The speakers sound like high quality Bluetooth and the speed and graphics are amazing!. I love this MacBook, I use it for photo and video editing and it works perfect for both. The sound is amazing on it, I honestly don\u2019t need any kind of headphones or studio speakers to hear the quality of sounds in my video.",
"Good for the price.. Great quality for the budget. As graphic designer I would describe as a great startup computer. Fast and reliable. Overheats a little bit though. Doesn\u2019t like to transfer programs from my older computer do I kind had to work my way around in order to get it done without loosing my data. So make sure you have a backup copy of all your files in case you need to restore it to default upon installation and setups.",
"great computer. Love the computer and price but it was not upgraded when we received it and that took twenty four hours as our internet is very slow. Also we still can not make email work even after talking with Apple care.",
"The best MacBook Pro of all time, at least until the Apple chips come.... Absolutely blazing speed for editing photographs compared to the 7 year old iMac I replaced with this. The i9 8-core processor is so fast that it opens Lightroom in 8 seconds. The keyboard has a perfect feel and the Space Gray is a beautiful design. Very happy with it and the screen size is big enough to be a desktop replacement. My only complaint is battery life, which seems to be about 5 hours for editing photos. If you are just answering emails and looking at the web, it lasts a lot longer. Until the Apple-based chips start shipping, this is the best there is.",
"Works great,. Honestly I was a bit worried about the overheating issues I read online but after 7 months of use, I can say my unit does not have that problem. My Macbook only has random restarts on sleep mode. Apparently all those issues are solved with Mac OS Big Sur beta. But I'm not ready to upgrade yet. My only regret is not getting 32GB of RAM.",
"Not happy. It stopped working. I can't turn it on after 1 month",
"Don\u2019t waste your money on the device\u274c\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e. I\u2019m really regret one of my biggest mistakes that i wast a lot of money on this device. Just after one month my mac shutdown every time I opened it for like 5 or 8 time I didn\u2019t use it a lof and I'm outside America so I couldn't return the device. The device now has two months of Reform Center and has not yet been repaired. And I really don\u2019t know what to do",
"Best Macboook Pro to date!. Best Macboook Pro to date! I bought the entry version 6-core / 16gb RAM / 512Gb and it\u2019s been great and solid so far in almost everything. Great screen, great keyboard, superb sound and mics (for a laptop) great battery life and of course very good performance. The only issue is the webcam... honestly they must be using a 720p wecamera from a decade ago. Very poor quality, almost unusable in low light conditions. Shame on you apple for saving on the camera for a 2.5k+ laptop. I would say that every selfie\u2019s cam above iPhone 5 is way better!!! For that reason I would give 4.5 stars",
"Transferred by Time Machine seamlessly!. I finally had to break down and replace my mid 2012 Power Mac since I could no longer update the OS. I was very concerned because I had set my MAC up exactly as I wanted it and didn\u2019t want to have to redo all my settings and reinstall apps, etc. I couldn\u2019t be happier! The time machine backup I had done on my old Mac worked absolutely seamlessly in just a couple of hours! And the new Mac runs sooooo much quicker that I\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019ve got it plugged into a 27\u201d Viewsonic monitor and it looks awesome! So glad I upgraded!",
"Not New or like new. This is not new or like new product. This is missing manual when i got it. It\u2019s body and charger have some black marks. This is used product.",
"Big Mac is a Big success..... I absolutely love this new Mac! Amazing display, sound, size, and speed....what more could you ask for. I already own a MacBook Pro, and feel that Apple really did a great job on this one. So far, no complaints. I still can\u2019t believe how large the display really is!! Honestly, the price was hard to digest. After seeing it, I wasn\u2019t disappointed",
"Have fun getting AppleCare if you order for business. Like many people I have a personal and a business account with Amazon. I first viewed this Macbook in my personal account, because that's what I was logged into at the time. There was an option to add Applecare with the purchase. Since I was ordering for work I logged out of my personal account and into our business account. When I viewed the item in my business account the option to add Applecare was not there. No problem, I thought, we'll just add the Applecare through the Apple website once we get it. We've done that a bunch of times with iPads and iPhones. Nope. Apple at first refused to sell us Applecare unless we had a receipt that included the serial number of the device, which neither the Amazon order summary, nor the packing slip included. Amazon support was not helpful at all. Their only suggestion was to return it. After working our way up the ladder with Apple support we finally were able to purchase the Applecare, but only after providing copies of the receipt, the packing slip AND a screenshot of the recent transactions on our business credit card. Took nearly 3 hours to resolve. Long story short - if you want Applecare protection with your $2200 Macbook - DON'T buy it from Amazon with your business account.",
"Going from window 10 to Apple macbook format is a easy transition.. Quality is very good. This is my first Apple laptop. I spend a day playing with it. I learned a lot of Apple protocol. I am not disappointed in buying this laptop.",
"It\u2019s all about luck. Laptop lags and stuck at login page all the time, battery drains 10 percent in 10 minutes.",
"I believe in paying for quality. In this case, it was worth it and earned.. My grandson was accepted to Tulane. As a graduation/Christmas gift I gave him this laptop. His wonderful bright appreciative smile was all I could ever want.",
"Why do they always change the input?. Overall this has been very good so far. I am really happy that Mac came out with the 16\" screen and the image clarity and performance is great. I really like the Touch Bar too. Still getting used to it but so far so good. Why did they feel the need to make this with only USB C inputs? That is extremely frustrating to me. The first adaptor I bought is awkward, feels like something is going to break off every time I use an HDMI or regular USB device. I just don't get the logic there. That is a problem in my opinion. I like the old magnetic charger better, and I'm pretty sure everybody has regular USB devices, so adaptors are required for everything.",
"Keyboard Issue - major headache. There is a major issue with the shift key (left side) on my keyboard. My previous Air had a great keyboard. Initially, I thought there may be a learning curve with the new magic keyboard. But alas, it's gotten even worse. I have to slowly and very deliberately hit the shift key - and even then watch to see if it performs its job. Frequently, even with slow and deliberate strikes, the key does not work. I can't tell you how frustrating this is while coding. Btw- I keep the keyboard clean and it's about 70 days old. Apple will replace the keyboard through a service center, but I will be without computer for 4-7 days. Since it's my primary tool for work+school, this is a poor option. I even followed up with apple to see if there are other options to being without the computer for a week - but no helpful options were presented. One last option still keeps the burden on me. Buying a external keyboard to use until I can the right time to send the computer for repair (ex. Christmas break). Note: (Hindsight is 20/20. The magic keyboard issue wasn't a user issue like I initially thought possible. Send yours straight back to apple if you have this issue like me).",
"This machine has a stutter. Prior to this machine, I had a 2014 MacBook Pro. This 2019 16\" is a beautiful, powerful machine with awesome sound and graphics, but: 1) There's a stutter in the machine whether it's typing, watching a Youtube video, etc. It's like it pauses for a mini-second periodically. 2) The trackpad is too large, so at times my palms will inadvertently contact it, causing the cursor to jump or an email to be sent that wasn't complete. 3) The Touchbar, although cool technically, is rather a pain practically. I much preferred the dedicated buttons, which I could even access in the dark!",
"Facinating Macbook pro 16 inch. This machine is an absolute beast, only problem I face is the heat through the aluminium body is irritating sometimes, way better than some windows laptop in the case of fan noise and trackpad, keyboard is the best part of it. After a month of usage I notice it has horrible battery life. As per their advertisement it is supposed to be atleast 10 hrs of battery life, but in relaity it dies after 4 hrs of usage.",
"Too Awesome. It is familiar since I am a MacBook Pro user yet it is awesome in the speed and graphics. Only complaint, if Apple is listening, is the location of the keyboard make my watch bracelet catches the surface. First World issue, yeah I know. 16 Inch is just too forking awesome.",
"Love It!! Great Cost Savings Of Over $300!. This is a legit MacBook Pro 16\" model from Apple. I was a little skeptical, and called Apple to check the serial number as soon as I got it. It's legit 100% and you save anywhere from $250-$400 depending on options at the time of order. Can't go wrong!!",
"Great product and great service.. Great product and great service. After a month of light use the camera stopped working. Luckily I had Apple Care. I took it Apple store and they got it replaced ( the entire screen/ top lid) and sent it back by FedEx express in 3 days. No issues since then.",
"Amazing laptop!. If like me, you\u2019ve been using Windows for years, the transition to Mac OS will take some getting used to but once you do, you\u2019re in for a fantastic experience. The hardware itself is blazingly fast and a joy to use!",
"Fabulous!. So much better than those cheap Windows computers. Sturdy and well-built. The software looks great and the screen is rich and vivid. The computer performs very well and definately meets (exceeds) my expectations. It can run Creative Cloud programs without any hangup and it interfaces with my new iPad Pro to provide a second screen. It can even connect to the iPad to utilize its cellular data connection--without any hassle or PW on my part.",
"Great laptop, but performance is not stable.. This laptop was great while everything works normally. I returned this item because it would restart every 3-4 hours and every time I would close the laptop for extended periods of time. This MacBook gets warm, but not hot when gaming or when running large, complex CAD models. The WIFI works great. I never got kicked off the WIFI or kicked out of a zoom meeting. Also, the large display is great for multitasking. On the other hand, this laptop is too big and heavy to carry around. This laptop is best used at a desk and moved every so often rather than being an everyday laptop carry unless it is the only device you need. The battery life is good when using macOS. I would get between 6-8 hours of mixed use. That is email, 10-12 Safari tabs, Microsoft Office, and Zoom. I only got 4-6 hours when using Windows. This machine is quiet and cool under and office-type workload, but it is pricey if you're looking for a larger laptop. The daily crashing, the short battery life, and the high cost are the reasons I could not keep the machine.",
"I guess I got a lemon.. big disappointment.. I guess I got a lemon, which is disappointing considering the high cost. All of the Thunderbolt ports had a short and would not stay connected, so I could not charge. I tried different Apple manufactured cables and power supplies with the same result. I was able to get one charge and the battery life was terrible (two hours). Sent this defective unit back to Amazon for a refund but they said that will take two weeks. I will wait this model out and see if there is a systemic quality issue.",
"Not at all worth the $$$. This thing is a MAJOR disappointment! It lags as I\u2019m just moving the cursor across the screen! It has ZERO USB ports, which means you have to carry an adaa as peter around with you to get anything done. The battery life is sub-par. I\u2019m lucky to get 4 hours out of it! I\u2019ve spent the past 2 months Researching how to even use this laptop to save date, pics, and media... not user-friendly! There is NO WAY this thing is worth the price tag! I\u2019ve had a $600 Asus laptop that functioned better than this -.-",
"Best Apple Laptop. This has been the best Apple Laptop I have owned I have had other's in the past which were good and gave me no problems, but the overall build quality, screen size ,and ease of use have been the best , the new keyboard they are using now has a bit more travel and is a joy to type on. I would Highly Recommend this Laptop with no reservations",
"MUST BUY.. I liked everything about it. I also bought accessories for it from Amazon as well. It was nothing different about it. The same experience I would have had if I ordered it from Apple. But, the product is still under Apple Amazon. I just wanted it ASAP! &amp; due to COVID-19 stuff takes way too long to ship so I got it from Amazon bc with my Prime account I got it the very next day. Prime is just the best thing anyways. Bc if you like me.. I want all my packages ASAP! I\u2019m impatient. But, yeah great experience, great purchase. This isn\u2019t my first Apple product ordered through Amazon either. I got my AirPods from Amazon too.",
"Expensive but good.... Good computer. Good specs but you\u2019re definitely paying for the name. I love it and the fact that I finally have a pro but the price is way higher than it should be. I purchased it for podcasts and photo editing and it\u2019s working good so far so no complaints other than the money",
"Love it best laptop out. Love it and I actually saved almost $200 from apples price (I was lucky caught a quick deal) as new machines rarely go on sale. What can I say I still use a 2009 17 inch MacBook Pro they last forever as long as you get the upgraded ones I think my 2009 work better than my friends new HP I would always tell people to get the upgraded one if you can as it buys you more time in the future. You can get 10 years easy out of a upgraded MacBook Pro",
"Non-Responsive Applications. Non-Responsive Applications including Safari and System Preferences often crash or take forever to open, the screen goes black every now and then for a second, and images and video don't preview or show thumbnails in finder.",
"Cool &amp; elegant looking laptop but need supply of dongles with laptop. This the first Mac Pro. It was touch switching to Mac from windows for decades. I love the the way it operates.Takes little time but as used to it it is charm. The con is that ot does not come with productivity apps and dongle. As you add accessories, it get expensive and sometime fustration as it happers your productivity lack of connectors amd required softwares. I also, feel thw battery life is short and get warm. Battery life and heat dissipation could be better. Except that i like using my first mac laptop.",
"Already replacing things after a month. Had this for a month and am already having to replace the charging cable. Get a chime noise every few seconds to indicate it\u2019s charging, then not charging. Cord is not damaged and laptop sits in the same spot so I\u2019m already shelling out additional money and I hope this is the issue. Not impressed.",
"Performance and Magic Keyboard are stupendous!. I like the thin bezels around the screen which resulted in a much fuller view screen for work and multitasking. Although the new display looks great--the keyboard is a significant added change since it includes Apple's new magic keyboard. It is probably the best Mac keyboard ever released by the folks at Apple. Overall, this new MacBook is rather pricey, but there's a reason it is called \"Pro\" because it is designed for professional. With this laptop you're paying for performance in a portable package.",
"FANTASTIC !. So happy with my NEW MacBook Pro! I have always used Mac but this is my first NEW purchase. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!",
"All in all, this is a computer worth buying. Keyboard changed back to scissors say feel much better The biggest trackpad I've ever seen looks wider than a keyboard, and it works, and it works. I've never used a MacBook trackpad before, and it's easy to use. As for the screen, this 16' large screen has a resolution of 3072*1920, which is super delicate. After watching this screen, other laptop screens should not enter the eye, and I don't know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.",
"No Buyers Remorse. I love it. It\u2019s a big improvement in speed over my 2011 MacBook Pro. I like to write, this makes it easier to do so. Also the sound quality of the speakers is amazing to listen to music with while writing. I can also enjoy editing photos more. All in all a solid machine. Glad I bought it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for you, but I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who likes to buy quality. I have no buyers remorse at all from this one.",
"Awesome Computer. Great product! It\u2019s everything you\u2019d expect from Apple. It did take about a week from order to arrive but it looks great and so far works great. We had our old one for 10 years and needed an upgrade- we hope this one lasts another 10.",
"Doesn't disappoint.. I didn't plan on buying this, but when Apple decided to announce their new Silicon plans - I had to grab an intel based macbook (I bootcamp - I mainly use Mac OS for iOS development and spend 80% of my time in windows). CPU is super fast, screen is great, keyboard is awesome - the only thing I wonder is how well the touch bar will hold up... but so far so good.",
"Lots to love and hate. Overall, the computer's performance is excellent, but the battery life is a joke, the giant mousepad a constant issue requiring most to adjust their normal hand placement, and Apple's decision to update all ports to USB-C will give you fits. Obviously, manufacturer design issues like these are unavoidable if you're upgrading to a new MacBook, but buy the required adapter cables and proper charging cable.",
"Great Computer. I held on to my previous MacBook Pro 13 inch for 7 years, and it served me very well, and I gave it away to a needy family who needed a computer for their children. Made this purchase and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Very easy to setup, I love the Touch ID, bright and crisp display, and it\u2019s fast speed. You really can\u2019t go wrong with the MacBook Pro for all your computer needs.",
"Worth the price, high performance. Best laptop I've used so far. Extremely fast, high processing power. I installed many heavy software like Adobe photoshop, PyCharm and IDEA Intellij and used all of them simultaneously and there was no performance drop at all. It's i9 processor and 16 GB RAM are able to handle very high work loads without any lag. The battery when fully charged lasts for at least 8 to 10 hours while using high processing software. The track pad gestures make it very easy and fun to use. It is definitely worth the price.",
"Best apple laptop so far. This is my 4th mac laptop. As all the reviews say, they got this one right! Even the base model has enough memory and storage for my music files and videos the keyboard is smoother than older models and the sound output is nice enough you don\u2019t automatically reach for bluetooth. Definitely appreciate the screen size as its mostly on the desk This was an amazon warehouse Purchase but I had no problems",
"Overheats with external monitors. Overheats when plugged into an external monitor.",
"Awesome laptop!. This MacBook Pro is AMAZING! I got it for my Dad and so far it is much easier for him to navigate than Windows and he loves the 16\u201d screen. Definitely happy with my purchase for sure!",
"Not that great beware.. This new 16\" is not noticeably faster. The only thing better is the 1TB SSD. I sold my 2015 i7 15\" MBP and I'm sorry I did. If I didn't this would have gone back. The Touch Bar is no big deal and Big Sur is just a bunch of changes and not for the good. I've been using Mac's since 1984 and this is a sub par machine..",
"Won\u2019t buy large electronic device at Amazon ever again. Bought one month and encounter system issue couple times and problems with track pad and can\u2019t even move mouse occasionally. Amazon doesn\u2019t like to let me return to them and ask me to find apple and apple can\u2019t solve the problem then kick me back to Amazon. Then I returned but they received the item for two week but hasn\u2019t started issue the refund. Product isn\u2019t good and the customer service you can tell by your self",
"Only 2 problems. I was disappointed that This new laptop does not have a SD card port. so I had to buy an adapter. Also the plug in port for electricity is not magnetic like my old laptop.",
"It\u2019s an apple so... Always a good choice! Glad it was on sale because I don\u2019t like paying full price for Apple products haha came wrapped in original plastic and shipped with care in protective box. Works properly and fully functional.",
"Integration with my various devices!. This was a replacement for my 2012 MacBook laptop that still worked. I felt I needed a replacement. Love the ability to work between my Tablet, iPhone, and my laptop. A very polished machine.",
"This is a great and powerful laptop. I love this prof doc because of the ability to to work back and forth and between all my Apple products, which is a huge help. In addition, the screen / monitor is excellent. The MacBook Pro 16\u201d is a phenomenal product for on the go and also simply to use like your desktop computer.",
"expensive but worth it. I decided to upgrade and get a macbook with a bigger screen because of all the work i do on the computer and this computer is amazing.. i am still getting used to it since i've had only 13in macbooks in the past. the sound quality is amazing, nice and loud with good sized speakers on each side of the keyboard. the battery life is very good, I have been on it for about an hour and a half now and the battery has only gone down about 9 percent. the touchbar on top of the keyboard is pretty cool, i have never owned a macbook with that feature and i really enjoy that i can unlock my computer with my fingerprint, it makes for lighting fast access. so far i am really impressed with it.",
"This is a steaming pile of dog crap!. Starts overheating the moment I turn it on... the screen locks up constantly... crashes nearly every time I use it... Updating the OS did not help... the only thing I can do to make it somewhat stable is to turn the display settings down to as low as they go, and even then it sometimes crashes. Honestly, a Chromebook is more useful than this garbage. Would not recommend to my worst enemy!",
"Apple product ... can't expect less than perfection. No need to write reviews about mac products anymore. One must acknowledge that new keyboard on this model is qay better than old 2018 and 2019 butterfly keyboards",
"Really nice, fast and gorgeous screen. I like the big gorgeous screen, how fast it is and the 16 Gb of memory is plenty to run many applications simultaneously. I didn't think it was going to be a big deal but I found the TouchId to be really nice - I like the way it lets me unlock the screen without having to type in my password.",
"Slim &amp; superior performing notebook. After doing lot of research I finally ordered this MacBook Pro and I am happy with my decision and research. This is the best laptop and Very Powerful performance. It is faster than my previous windows laptop. The new i-9 processor 16 GB RAM and 2.3 ghz core speed make it beast. I couldn\u2019t take off my hands after configuring it. Everything working perfectly so far. Only down is it\u2019s weight but overall it\u2019s best. Performance and look is same as described in Amazon description. Happy to switch from Windows to Apple.",
"Delivered. The box was open when deliver I haven't had a chance to take it to geek squad have appointment on 04/28/20. Will see if not damage",
"Returned faulty mac. Save yourself the hassle and pay the extra money by getting this from the official apple store. On the very first start up while the progress bar was loading, the screen went weirdly green/static for 1-2 seconds then went back to normal, I let that go and thought that maybe it was just an odd occurrence. I just kept using my laptop normally for the rest of the day. The next day i was using iMovie for the first time ever and after importing a video that I received via airdrop i noticed that the sound was messed up. I'd recommend just buying this from the official apple website / the apple store",
"The best \ud83d\udcaf. I love my MacBook Pro. It\u2019s everything I thought it would be and more. The speakers sound better than my dang TV!!! The picture quality and brightness are fantastic. The trackpad is superb and the keyboard JUST WORKS! So glad they ditched the butterfly keyboard. I wasn\u2019t able to purchase the apple care for this product through amazon and for some reason I couldn\u2019t get it online either even though it stated it qualified for it, but Apple customer care helped me right away and fixed the problem. Couldn\u2019t be happier. \ud83e\udd29",
"Nice!. This is a beautiful computer. Large screen and not terribly heavy. As with all MacBooks I recommend getting a keyboard cover. They are easy to type with and can save a lot of hassle, as the keys easily collect dirt, crumbs, and dust without it (which can result in keys not working).",
"Great laptop no USB ports. I\u2019ve owned MacBook Pro\u2019s in the past and I\u2019m always extremely satisfied with them. Enjoy the touchpad and the keyboard. The display is beautiful. Only drawback is there are no USB ports. I had to buy an adapter to be able use USB drives. Only drawback so far.",
"Great Computer overall!. Computer works great, has really wonderful graphics, lots of memory, and a nice keyboard. On the downside, it's pretty heavy and the bottom gets really hot.",
"It's a very good laptop but. Great sounds, magical keyboard, beautiful display but it does get unnecessary hot and drains the battery fast, run a couple of video editing software for 30 minutes and you will not need to microwave your pizza.",
"It. Just. Works.. I bought an XPS 13 before this and hated every minute of it and returned it within a week. Using this 16 inch MBP has been a magical experience! It seems pricy but a device this good will last for years! I love every minute of it. Works like a beast no matter what you throw at it. The keyboard feels so good I wanted to cry first time I typed on it. If you got the dough, look no further. Cons: I\u2019m used to 13 inch so this felt HUGE and very heavy, barely fits in my backpack. Also, it\u2019s not meant for gaming so, don\u2019t even try.",
"The best gift. My wife's MacBooks were older and she was debating replacing one with the smaller, older MBP that this one replaced. There are several ways to say Happy Birthday; this one worked pretty well...",
"Makes great videos. My videographer uses this for our videos, works great",
"Great buy!. Amazing buy! Steal of a deal. I showed the post to an Apple store rep and they couldn't believe the price! They confirmed that it was identical to the one I was just about to buy in store and even recommended this one! Don't hesitate!",
"Great. Such an amazing laptop I\u2019ve been dreaming about , the battery is ok while I\u2019m not using a program that consume the processor such as Final Cut, the sound is beautiful the bass is so great , I love it I\u2019m including a pic comparing next to my old 13\u201d MacBook Air",
"Apple MacBook Lives Up To It\u2019s Reputation!. Pros: it\u2019s everything my college kid required and wanted. Screen resolution good. Set up easy. Works well. Good battery power. Well worth the money. Bought the extended warranty. It\u2019s an investment for sure. Cons: pricey after adding warranty and taxes.",
"Not refunded for return. Product too heavy. Returned and have not received refund.",
"NO CAMERA. NO CAMERA, NONE, NEIN. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND NOW A CAMERA ISNT IMPORTANT? I AM RETURNING IT.",
"Excellent!. I bought this machine to replace my 11 year old MacBook Pro, which I am still using for personal needs but couldn't keep up with professional demands. It's hard to believe how much faster the new Mac is. The quality of the display is incredible. The only downside is that none of my peripherals have USB-C ports, so I need to purchase adapters until the peripherals get replaced.",
"good product. good product",
"Meh. Sadly my Thinkpad x1 yoga 3rd gen runs rings around this core i9 and it has the ultra low wattage 8th gen I7. I bought this for a project. It is underwhelming -tbh. Beautifully spec\u2019d but will throttle and gpu will give out requiring a reboot when doing any intensive video encoding. And the lack of ports really sucks. Sure -get a dongle but like I said at the beginning of the post -my thinkpad really runs rings around this core i9 \u201cbeast\u201d.",
"Best MacBook. Great laptop, great battery life! I\u2019m glad Apple is giving more value to their customers when compared to previous models. You are still paying an Apple tax, but if you are like me and prefer MacOs, this is a great option.",
"Defective. arrived defective. was never able to get it turned on.",
"Love it.. I like the touch bar, keyboard and the speakers on the 2019 MacBook Pro. They are a big improvement from the mid 2015 I previously owned. I have used the laptop for a little more than 2 months and I am a big fan of the quality of the product. I would highly recommend this!",
"Excellent laptop!. I have had this laptop for a little over two weeks now and I love it. This is my first MacBook and I intend on using it for school. It seems to perform much better than my previous MSI laptop. The display is absolutely amazing. The battery life and speed at which this laptop carries out task has been very impressive. I cannot wait to see how this computer will aid me in my Computer science degree.",
"If you're a Mac power user, this is a great option. I really like this laptop but there are a couple complaints. The sound didn't blow me away as I was led to believe it would. It's good not great. It's a powerful computer but in my opinion didn't offer enough change over the previous years to justify the total cost.",
"I prefer MACOS over all.. Like my 2011 MACBK PRO THIS UNIT OVER HEATS AND IT IS WORRYSOME FOR ME AS IT ALSO HAS AN AMD DISCRETE GPU. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS APPLE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A HANDLE ON COOLING. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT EDITING AS IT GETS TOO HOT JUST CHECKING MAIL AND NORMAL USE. OVERALL ITS STILL BETTER THAN BEING STUCK WITH USING A PC.",
"The battery is junk. The battery will not hold a charge. We need to take it to an Apple store and it has been out of the box for 2 days!",
"Ridiculously good. Everything about this machine is ridiculous. Ridiculously good. Especially the speakers. Hot damn. Hot. Damn.",
"Best Mac yet. I just received it today, and have been using for about two hours now. SO FAR best MacBook Pro I have had. I used to have the older model but 15' from 2017. Immediately I love the screen, the extra inch of size really makes a difference.. perfect screen size in my opinion and the weight feels great. Key board types beautiful, the Touch ID is now separate like the escape key, so it adds to the beautiful design and the touch pad pops out a bit (sexy). Screen is immaculate. Over all so far an epic piece of hardware",
"Greatest of all!. The greatest and the best computer I have ever used. Very fast, great screen, fantastic keyboard and wonderful speakers. Though expensive but it is worth the money.",
"The battery is not up to 10 hours as described!. The battery is not up to 10 hours as described!",
"Bought a used one from Amazon Warehouse, Works great!. I bought this used with \"minor damage\". Came in mint condition, except battery has been dying quickly. It did however come with only 5 battery cycle charges. Recommend it, this is the best of the 15+ MacBook's I've ever owned!",
"Get extremely hot under normal use. I just started my new Macbook Pro yesterday, and noticed that the mac heat up very badly. I was not even using any heavy application (just browsing around) and it get so hot that I can't even put it on my lap. Trying to get apple tech support to help on this issue...",
"There is always something.. The only complaint I have, had nothing to do with the quality of the item itself. The MacBook Pro arrived in its factory packaging with a small chip on the edge near the track pad. This was mostly done in the factory before packaging. Due to the large amount of padding in the boxes it arrived in I do not believe it was caused by transit. Otherwise I very much enjoy the product.",
"Lousy fan noise. Bought this as a gift for my family. Here is my main concern. The fan noise sounding like a jet taking off as soon as it has any kind of load. I doubt if it has anything to do with the AMD graphic card. Apple switch to AMD in this generation of MBP, and I heard it was never like this before. Overheating is another issue.",
"Longer and longer boot time. I used to complain how long it takes Windows to boot. Now Windows10 boots fast whereas Big Sur requires multiple reboots to start up. Each iteration of the macOS takes longer to boot than the previous one.",
"Best laptop I\u2019ve owned. I love my new MacBook. I\u2019ve had it for a about four months now, and I still can\u2019t help but smile using it. Runs quiet and cool. Battery life is solid. Display is beautiful. Speakers sound amazing. And yes the keyboard is fantastic. Thumbs up.",
"It\u2019s fast with a great keyboard and screen. I love the screen and the new keyboard on this!! I never really had a problem with my 13 inch keyboard...but I would never go back. Battery life seems to be as advertised so far, and performance is great.",
"Nice Computer. This is my first Mac and after 3 months I am very happy. I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem so it is nice to have everything at my fingertips on this computer. It is a bit expensive.",
"Runs hot. Case heats up very quickly to the point it is too hot to hold or have in lap. Definitely not worth buying.",
"MacBook Pro 16. Great laptop at a great price. Delivered fast. Very happy.",
"Best of the best. What can you say, it's an Apple product. Easy to setup. Using it with wireless keyboard and trackpad, and external monitor. Small issue: fan comes up too often ( I do application development with it).",
"Terrific 17\u201d screen. Love my new Mac laptop Good value from Amazon",
"Screen a distortion in corner. well we noticed as time was going on the bottom right screen became a little red colorist more and more ! when i called they said its just the color pattern of the screen and should be fine...however seems to be somewhat getting worst...",
"DON\u2019T BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!!. I was so happy once I received my new laptop. Open the box connected all my links and ready work on some pictures that I had taken. Press the power button nothing, checked the connection as well as the power....tried thinking it was finger recognition...nothing. The battery feels like its overheating let it cool off shipping back ASAP. I am so disappointed. Seller offered a refund or replacement. I think a refund at this point is best. \u2639\ufe0f",
"MAC FOREVER!!!. What can I possibly say about a brand new larger screen MacBook Pro. It is wonderful. The upgrades are great and the color with the retina viewing is amazing. Once I got a Mac I never went back!",
"Wrong stuff. Got the wrong macbook soo unhappy",
"the fuzzy sound problem still persist. Is very well know that some macbook starts to have a fuzzy and weird sound when you reproduce any audio in high volume, I bought this laptop hoping this was fixed already, but since some days ago I started to get the same noisy sound. Is not good that a so expensive laptop have this kind of problems",
"Poor shipping, great product. 5 stars for the computer. Apple always delivers good quality products that I know I will have for a while. 1 star for shipping - shipped under a 45-pound bedframe with no packing materials",
"Perfection!. The package was in perfect condition upon arrival. The laptop booted up and installed updates immediately and setup was a breeze. Couldn\u2019t be happier with this!!!",
"I could not get it hooked up and returned it. Very sad.. I had a miserable time hooking it up and retuned it. This is not a reflection on the computer but me. I did not care for the lack of input devices.",
"Best Macbook I have purchased!. Performance. Love the new screen size and the new keyboard. The speakers on this thing are truly impressive for such laptop with such a thin frame. Overall, great Macbook for anyone - from day to day work to photo editing, video editing, music production etc.",
"Awesome...totally FANTASTIC!. Extremely pleased with my NEW MacBook Pro! I haven\u2019t found anything yet that I don\u2019t like. I LOVE it!",
"Good deal. Love the computer. Was surprised Amazon sold for such a discount. No complaints so far (and had for a few months now). Was brand new when it arrived.",
"Satisfied. Good one, but too much of heat generated during load on the laptop.",
"That is new product !!. help friend to brought it, coz her don't have account for amazon. I just looking for the view by another customer to buy, suggestion you guys choose this one. The color and style I like it.",
"New Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage) - Space Gray. What can I say\u2014it\u2019s an Apple and I love it.",
"Great Value for a Used Product. Bought this \u2018used very good condition\u2019 MacBook 16 from Expercom. Looks like I lucked out; it was pristine with only 7 battery cycles. What\u2019s more, it had been purchased 3 weeks before so was able to add AppleCare. Truly an outstanding value at about 80% of retail. Very happy.",
"Great performance, and fun touchbar. Arrived earlier than expected and exceeded expectations. Great processing power and easy transition from old laptop (MacBook Pro 17\", 2010). During COVID-19, was thankful that delivery driver waited a safe distance for me to acknowledge delivery. Very smooth from order to delivery.",
"Macbook for the CREATORS. This is what I was seeking from apple for a long time. Best display, good battery life, slim design and silent operation. It is a power packed machine. I don't think you will regret your purchase.",
"Great machine. Wonderful machine",
"OMG, what a wonderful difference.. Having been a 13\" Macbook Pro fan for years, I finally decided to go bigger. What a wonderful surprise ! Quick, clear, lightweight, responsive. Love the feel of the new keyboard.",
"I love it!. The reason I rated 3 for gaming is because I don't use it for that. Same for touchscreen, of course I have a touch bar. I would rate that 6.",
"Favorite MacBook. Came quickly. Genuine apple product. Was able to get apple care through apple, you just need to contact apple support and they\u2019ll kindly help you out! Love having a MacBook again. The Touch ID is cool.",
"I\u2019m in love!!. The best thing I own honestly. Speakers and screen are impeccable! Only thing is it doesn\u2019t have ports but you can easily get an adapter for everything!",
"Elegant and Sturdy .. I love that this is an Apple \ud83c\udf4e product and it comes with an expensive price with it .it is very thin and very elegant .I love its specs and functionality .",
"Best laptop ever used. This was probably the best part of 2020, I love this thing. The battery is amazing and the new keyboard is so nice! Apple has really outdone themselves with this model. The screen quality is beyond anything I imagine (I came from a 2011 model) and the size is perfect. The best screen ever! Best laptop ever!",
"best laptop ever. This replaced my 2011,10 year old macbook pro. I expect to get 10+ years from this one. How long did your last pc last. nuff said.",
"Amazing!. Awesome laptop! Very fast! Love the big screen, and the speakers are phenomenal. Also worth noting - Apple brought back the old keyboard - it\u2019s great!! It was delivered quickly and well packaged. Extremely happy with my purchase!",
"Send it back. It locked up and wouldn\u2019t except password",
"Not worth the money. Love apple products. The only reason why three stars since this laptop not worth the money I paid.",
"This is exactly the Macbook Pro I have wanted. So after hating my last Macbook Pro and the terrible butterfly keyboard. I actually bought a PC and tried to use it. But they fixed what I hated and this one has a great keyboard that's easy and fun to type on. Screen is great, battery lasts forever... Finally!",

"A magnificent laptop. Basically, the laptop is a work of art. You know exactly what you\u2019re buying with an Apple product. I love that it comes with 16 GB of memory as default. The video card is very powerful. The touchpad is huge and works flawlessly. It is expensive, but worth every penny.",
"USB Adapter not included. No issues with the computer so far but I find it ridiculous that they don\u2019t include the USB adapter in the box &amp; you have to buy it separately. Especially with the price tag of this laptop.",

"Very Good iPad Air. It is well made, Liked it had two positions when opened rather than just one. However, it would have been better if it had three reading positions when opened.",
"Good Portable Video editing Machine. Over all I love Mac because of its long lasting quality. I need a machine to edit my 6K BRaw footage captured on my Black Magic and this serves the purpose. It has a little heating issue and the fan is often too loud which I do not mind for the portability it provides.",
"what's Important. i was not impressed when it was delivered because it was not a sign package when it should be because it was over $1,000. it was left outside of my garage which i did not like because of the volume and cost of the computer. It's a good quality computer, great picture.",

"Would recommend. What I like was that this deal gave me the choice to choose if I wanted to pay a higher price from Apple.com with free AirPods or a much cheaper price without AirPods. The one thing I don't like is the overheating problem, but that's from apple side, not amazon.",
"I love this machine.. Great laptop. Found out it can't handle being left out in the rain without an umbrella, though! Apple was unwilling to pay for the replacement.",

"Quality of Apple computers a step above. Loving the new 16 inch MacBook. Never used a trackpad very much before on laptops, but ease of use this MacBook makes you want to use it. The dynamic menu options bar at top of the keyboard is a very nice, in addition to the Touch ID,",

"New Mac man.. Lovin\u2019 it!",

"OVERHEATS when you connect an external monitor. I have had the 8-core i9 model for 2 months. Reddit it full of complaints that their macbook sounds like a jet engine and overheats if they connect to an external monitor. Apple customer support has no clue, or claims this is intended behavior. After careful search, I have observed that this is due to a series of fundamental design flaws. 1. You can only use the discrete AMD GPU when connecting an external monitor. Other laptops can use the Intel GPU. Also, you can only use the AMD GPU on Bootcamp. This makes battery life ~3 hours on Bootcamp. 2. The AMD GPU is a power hog. My laptop is pulling over 100 Watts from the wall, measured with a meter. It increases my energy bill. 3. Things are worse in Windows (Bootcamp). If I play a light video game (such as AoE2), the laptop gets so hot and draws so much power that the battery starts to empty. After 30-60' of gameplay, battery drops to 70%-50% of charge, while plugged in. 4. The heat sink of the GPU and CPU are connected. The CPU goes up to 80 Celsius at idle when connecting an external monitor, while idling. 5. The final nail in the coffin. When the CPU gets hot, macOS launches a process called kernel_task. One of the functions of the kernel task process is to help manage the temperature of your CPU. Ironically kernel_task then takes up all of my 8 cores. This shows up as 800% CPU use on the activity monitor. This unavoidably makes the CPU much hotter, and triggers a vicious circle. Then my 16\" macbook becomes unusable and I have to reboot. If you think this behavior is insane, and must be a bug, guess again. Apple intends for mac OS to behave this way. Google 'apple support HT207359'. Other issues include. -No Nvidia/CUDA support. Even if I want to plug in an external Nvidia GPU, Apple is now blocking it. (All my old Macs support Nvidia in High Sierra, but this one only runs Catalina.) -No touch/stylus support. I cannot use the touchbar to draw figures when I teach/present. -No 32-bit application support. I can no longer use my equation editors. -Severe screen ghosting issues. Google it. -Severe random crash/restart issues. -Power delivery issues. It starts discharging when plugged in if I am doing computational work. -Not sure why reviewers praise the speakers. They are bass heavy bangers. The highs are very sibilant, \"S\" sounds like \"TH\". I had to use an EQ to reduce the sibilance, but it cannot be removed completely. Also, the speakers pop when you start or stop a video. Apple claims it is a software issue, but the latest Catalina 10.15.4 has not fixed it. It only happens with low frequency sounds, which is why many users have not noticed it, but it is there. This is just a partial list of flaws. I regret my purchase. I will sell this laptop and will buy a used 2014 Macbook with an Nvidia GPU instead.",
"Great computer with a fatal flaw. I bought a maxed out 16\" 2.4GHz with 64GB of DDR and 8GB of integrated graphic RAM and a 2TB SSD Overall the computer is great *but* I would strongly recommend *against* purchasing one because there is a major issue that I believe to be at the hardware level. The Macbook Pro regularly gets very hot and crashes and has done so since I received it. Many others have experienced this same issue and it seems to happen almost independently of what I'm doing. I've had a long history from the Titanium PowerBook Pro G4 through several of the unibody MacBook Pros and this is at least my 6th Mac and I couldn't be more disappointed. The previous generation had a horrible issue with the keyboard which they have at least resolved here, but the machine is exceedingly frustrating especially given that mine was far from cheap. Can not in good conscience recommend getting one.",
"Avoid the 16\" MBP like the plague, ..... If you plan to use the 16\" MBP with an external monitor. Avoid it at all costs. There are dozens of threads online discussing these issues. Macrumors forum has a single thread with over 100 pages of 16\" MBP owners desperate for a solution. When not using an external monitor, it's hotter and noisier than pervious models, but when used with an external monitor, the heat goes through the roof...and the fans noise is insane. I've had MS Teams, Zoom and other sessions where people asked me, \"What is that loud noise in your background...it's hard to hear you.\" Apple Support denies there is a problem and refuses to replace or fix the machines. I'm currently trying to decide what to buy as a replacement for my 16\" MBP.",
"Great computer! (Also discount). Great computer! though the cooling system is not that good, so after some minutes it gets a little hot in the middle upper part of the keyboard. I will use it for school so it\u2019s perfect. Also, if you are planing to buy it for school, you can buy it from the apple web site, and in only costs 2199 us$, so you have a 200 us$ discount. Really good. (also if you are not a student, i think you can buy it ;) )",
"Fatal flaw with audio, left unfixed for 9 months. Unfit for professional or personal use.. I've had this computer for many months and it's often unusable because of a persistent problem with the audio where persistent crackling and (less often) stuttering occurs. Thus, the computer is unusable for most professional/critical applications, and can't even be used enjoyably for casual applications that rely on audio (i.e., watching videos, listening to music). Apparently, Apple knows about this issue (there are many instances of it being mentioned on the Apple support forums, in the tech press, and on YouTube, by frustrated vloggers. Apple's inaction suggests that this isn't a simple software problem but something much harder to remedy. It's terrible that there is no workaround that works (at least not for me\u2014some suggest killing the audiocored process or other fixes, but these things do nothing). My advice to you is to AVOID the 16\" MacBook until you can get confirmation these issues are addressed. You should search \"16 MacBook crackle problem\" and similar terms to see that thousands of people have similar problems.",
"Freezes and restart frequently. There is a hardware problem with this device. It freezes several times in a day. After every freeze there is some sound and the device reboots. This problem is faced by many users, just google \"apple macbook pro 16 freezes\". My MBP has been freezing from day one. Reinstalling the OS twice, but the problem persists. Apple is not able to offer any hardware or software solution. According to service centre the mother board needs to be replaced. They have NO PARTS available. In India they don't even have replacement policy. It is more than a week and they have not yet offered any solution. HOPELESS product and WORST service from Apple.",
"Wake up Lemmings and don't buy Apple!. I just switched from being an Apple Mac Owner since 1986 because of poor quality, high prices and horrible customer service. After paying a premium for my Macbook Pro 2015, Model ID 11,4 it first had a recall on the battery in 2018. I had the batter replaced and since then I've had it in service twice for HD issues. First the problem was a cable connection that came loose, probably as a result of the battery replacement and then the HD failed. After paying nearly $2,600, the cost of a new HD would be $980 at the Apple repair facility. Besides the loss of funds, it is a huge loss in work-time and energy. Today, Apple's proprietary obsession and lack of upgrade-ability no longer make Apple an economically sound solution. On top of that, Apple's software has become cumbersome, complicated and quickly makes your hardware obsolete. Apple's focus has shifted from providing quality products to being another parasitic 'service' provider.",
"Battery and overheating issues with 2019 16\" MacbookPro. 2019 16\" MacBook pro was purchased as a gift at Costco warehouse in November 2019. Unfortunately, the gift box wasn't opened until March 2020. When it was opened, it failed to even power-on. Apple support diagnosed a problem with the batter after a series of troubleshooting and asked to ship it back for battery replacement. The first time I'm ever sending an apple product for repair over the past two decades! I thought this must have been one-off a problem since I had never experienced any hardware issue with other Macbook Pro or iPads or iPhones in the past. After the laptop was returned from repair, I started noticing that the battery does not last for more than 2 - 2.5 hours at the maximum. The charge will go down from 100% to 20% in just under 2 hours. Contacted Apple again and it performed another series of remote diagnostics, determined an issue with holding the charge. I was asked to send my Apple to repair once again. Apple repair notified me this time saying that the speaker unit had a liquid contact and battery repair would cost me $699 + tax. Like other high-end apple peripherals, I take the utmost precaution in using Apple products and wasn't aware of any instance where liquid could have come in touch, or had any issues with the speaker. Either Apple is trying to upcharge for a service that should have been typically covered in a warranty (Replacement battery on a brand new laptop not holding up the charge) by saying liquid damage, or they damaged the battery during one of the two times the laptop was at their repair facility. Apple support told me that the only options I have were to pay $699 for the repair or have the unit returned as is. For a high-end laptop that costs a premium (paid around $2600), I was expecting that it would last for 3 - 5 years for business use without any issue. Alas, it didn't even last three months and spent two weeks in the repair center twice during the past three months. The 16\" unit also becomes hotter with 45 minutes of regular browser use. I didn't have similar issues with 13.3\" Macbook Pro that I purchased around the same time last year. Reviewing Mac forums online, I see many complained about similar battery and heating issues with the 2019 16\" model. Apple has gone back years in HW quality on its 2019 model. Had it been within a 90-day purchase period window, I would have returned this to Costco. I will rather buy a high-end PC for $699 (instead of having the MacbookPro repaired). Avoid buying this 16\" MacBook Pro 2019 model for peace of mind or purchase AppleCare (which costs $300 for 3-year insurance, plus $299 for each instance of repair incident) if you must buy one.",
"disappointing. no USB port, no matte display, no DVD drive, no card reader, no UTP port, no AC power on without battery ... I had to switch to a PC",
"Major Flaw with Third Party Displays. This version does not seem to support third party displays. My 2018 MacBook 15.4 supports Acer 4K and other monitors, the 2019 16 MacBook Pro does not. Went thru two different MacBooks and tech support with Apple. Finally just returned. If you need to use an external monitor that\u2019s not Apple be aware of this major flaw.",
"Nice laptop with stuttering issues. Good laptop overall - you can check other reviews for that I wanted to report an issue on my stock configuration that many people on Reddit and MacRumors have. The cursor will stutter for 0.5-1 seconds randomly. This happens intermittently whenever graphics switching is activated. It makes the laptop feel buggy and sluggish. People have figured out that disabling graphics switching solves the microstutters but requires the discrete GPU to run all the time. This leads to excess heat and is not an ideal fix. This is not a hardware problem because it does NOT occur on Windows 10. A clean install of MacOS does NOT resolve the issue. While setting up from a new install, stutters are seen before any 3rd party software or accessories are used. This is most likely a problem with the crappy intel graphics driver. Users have messaged Apple about this 5 months ago but there is no fix. They will suggest you change some cursor settings but it does not work. The fact that random people on the internet have figured out a fix before Apple is sad. I still like the laptop and use it everyday but the stutters get annoying.",
"This experience was horrible.. Nothing against the Mac book but the horrible, unprofessional service given to me by Amazon was pure garbage. First I'm told that my laptop was scheduled for delivery Aug 4 at 8. No one contacts me the entire day, I receive a email 1 min before the scheduled time of delivery stating the would not be delivering my laptop. To make matters worse they have no idea where the laptop is, or even when it would be delivered. The management were just nonchalant about the whole ordeal. I guess that is normal procedure.I see now Amazon shall no longer be my go to for services needed. I'm thinking also closing my Amazon music accounts..just pure trash.",
"Its like the developers never used it themselves. The specs are good, the Touch Bar on the top is cool. The keyboard layout is TERRIBLE. If you use this on a day to day basis you will suffer. HALF of the laptop is a touch pad. The other half is a keyboard far away from the edges. This means your hands will uncomfortably be reaching over the lap top and resting on the edges while you type. I consistently get scratches and marks on my arm from pressing against it and I have to use a towel or something over the HUGE DEAD SPACE on the edges of the lap top to protect my arms. Don't get me started about the fan being on the bottom, so all the hot air get thrown back from the table back onto the lap top and does not properly cool. It seriously is like they just made it without the dev team using it or thinking about the layout.",
"Apple lost its way in 2013 and the MacBook never been the same. I owned one of these for 2 weeks and hated it so much I returned it. * The keyboard is only a slight improvement over the butterfly keyboard. The Lenovo Thinkpad series has a much nicer keyboard. Typing on the MacBook Pro feels like typing on a stone slate. * The display has very poor response time and clear ghosting issues, most easily observed while scrolling text. It's not even a real 4K display - almost every other laptop on the market now offers a genuine 4K display. * Ports - only USB-C, because Apple says so. Yet more than half of the devices I want to plug in are still USB-A. I don't want to pay for the replacement dongle subscription service which Apple will probably announce soon. No SD card slot either, because, you know, you're an iPhone user and you don't have an SD card slot on your phone either (unlike e.g. Samsung Galaxy devices that offer fully expandable MicroSD storage). * Performance. On par with my late-2013 MacBook Pro. A slight improvement but still much slower than my desktop PC. * The sound. Yes, in the store, these will be the loudest speakers on any laptop. But I couldn't stand listening to them for more than 10 minutes. The speakers are overdriven and weirdly phased. The speakers pop when pausing or playing audio. * The touchbar. Quite possibly the most irritating gimmick Apple has ever stuck with for so long. Yet if you don't like it, it's almost impossible to turn off. * Cost. The entry level model is too expensive but has very limited RAM and SSD. The package gets far more expensive as soon as you add enough RAM or SSD storage to make the machine usable. PC laptops don't suffer this issue because they are user upgradable (and, for that matter, user repairable). Don't buy one of these and then end up in a situation where you regret it but can't return it. Look at Windows laptops instead. Windows has improved a lot over the last decade, if you're a developer you can use WSL2 to get a full Linux terminal experience, and you won't be locked into Apple's evil ecosystem, a world where very soon all Mac app purchases will no doubt require paying a 30% Apple tax. There are so many other great laptop manufacturers out there (Lenovo, Dell, Razor, HP, etc.) and they deserve your business, in a way that Apple no longer does.",
"Ridiculously Fragile Screen. Watch out! This screen is REALLY fragile. It WILL break if you look at it cross eyed. Mine cracked while sitting untouched on my desk. My friend's cracked after sliding two inches from her lap to the carpet. Google it. See how many people there are who claim they did NOTHING to it and the screen just cracked. And guess what? Unless you bought apple plus coverage it will cost you $700 to fix it. Even with apple plus they charge you to fix it, just less. I love the computer, it is wonderful. But apple knows this product is flawed. The screen was made too flimsy in order to make it lighter. You might get lucky but If I were you I wouldn't spend this much money to get robbed later.",
"Exactly What I Needed. This is the best computer I've ever owned or used. I'm 45 years old, love computers, and have used them in a variety of capacities at home and at work for nearly 30 years. However, I would also add that I'm not in a creative professional career, so I have never needed to max out a computer's horsepower, and I couldn't tell you about the highest-end computers. This review is not to be mistaken for a comparison to those $6K+ models out there. I bought the higher of the two base models in the 2019 MBP 16\" lineup: 2.3GHz i9, 16gb RAM, 1TB SSD, and 5500M Graphics card. I'm a little impatient and being cautious about COVID, so I bought this directly from the Apple Store because I knew I could pay online and do a quick drive-by to pick it up and have it at my house within the hour. I initially wanted to upgrade to 32GB of RAM, but I discovered that the Apple Store tends to only carry the standard model configurations they feed you on their website. If you want an upgrade, you'll probably have to order online or through a Big Box retailer, unless you just get lucky. I should also add that I didn't want to order a computer to be mailed to my house because we routinely receive battered cardboard deliveries and I didn't want to deal with exchanging or returning if the driver was having a bad day. Plus, there is the whole lack of patience thing I've got. I work from home and this is my computer situation: Google Chrome with 5-10 open tabs, MS Outlook open, MS Teams open, MS Word and Excel open. I open Adobe Acrobat all day long, off and on, and I keep Photoshop open because I dabble in photo editing here and there through the day, on breaks. I'm on 2 hours of Zoom meetings most days. I have been scrubbing a 3TB photo/video collection, so Amazon Photos and the Photos App are opened here and there, along with apps called Duplicate File Finder and Silent Sifter (organization apps to clean up files and delete duplicates). My 2015 Macbook Air performed surprisingly well with all of that, considering the specs, BUT ... I did get the spinning rainbow frisbee if I pushed it too hard or an app might freeze and not open again until I forced it to quit. It was frustrating. When I go into the office I use a new Mac Mini and it does a better job than the MBA, but still room for improvement. As it turns out, 16GB of RAM has been more than enough for my dabbling in creating book covers and editing photos. I also edited some 1080P video and it rendered quickly. The Cinebench Score is around 3300. If I were a \"bigtime\" video person, doing lots of rendering, I would have upgraded to the 8GB of Graphics Card, and recommend you do that, too, if that's something you are concerned about. Editing photos and opening lots of apps and tabs is more of a RAM thing, though. You can never go wrong with too much RAM (unless on a budget). I would again stress that 16GB has been more than I have needed and I have intentionally opened a lot and lots of processes going. The keyboard is a true pleasure. Wow. It's the best I have typed on, both desktop and laptop. Unlike some, I LOVE the touchbar. This model goes on sale here and there, so don't pay full price!",
"Too Much Laptop for the Battery - Epic Fail from Apple. I have owned Macs since 1985. I even sold them at a local Apple VAR for years. This is a very nice laptop (sound, screen) but the battery is woefully underpowered for this machine. I wanted a professional laptop for work but I need to plug this thing in 2 or 3 times a day to recharge just to get through the work day. Apple support ran diagnostics and said the battery is within acceptable performance range but I disagree. I started out with about 8 to 10 hours run time and now I am at less than 6 hours runtime per charge, often less. The case gets hot too and burns my lap. I move around a lot when I work and I need a battery to last the work day. Browsing web pages, attending webex calls, managing 4-5 apps and numerous files all day long should not be draining my battery so fast. I was excited to get this machine but I now have familiar Apple buyers regret. This company just does not care any longer about putting out insanely great products; just 'nice' ones. I asked my company to send me a Dell laptop so I can get some work done when my Mac Book Pro drains out. I wish Apple would put a decent battery in their laptops for a change. I feel cheated.",
"Only for you if you want a paperweight. Apple used to be pretty good at hardware design. This machine was a complete and total flop, the battery life is at best 1/4 of the previous generation. The oled bar is only \"useful\" to those that don't use it, everyone I know that doesn't mind it maps \"real\" keys to do what they want. The mousepad is so large that I invariably touch it un-intentionally to constantly annoy my work flow as buttons get pressed unintentionally. I'm seriously interested in losing half my money to sell this pos for whatever I can get. I really really wish I hadn't upgraded as my older 2015 based laptop was so much better than this one. The only feature I would say was not a complete disappointment is the making of usb-c the only port. While this does make you have to buy all new dongles, it is nice to your workflow to be able to plug in anywhere.",
"Lack of ports completely ruins this computer. I've been a macbook user for 10 years. I stretched out my old one as long as possible to avoid buying the new USB-C only models. It's worse than a thought. What a pain. using stupid hubs and adapters. I hate it.",
"Kill the Touch Bar. The touch bar is ridiculous. I'm sure there are isolated people who actually think it provides some value, but as a professional designer myself surrounded by similar across 3 continents, I have a reasonable sample size of hatred. Apple, of course, used to care what it's users want...but now they treat us with contempt. Is it any surprise we hate them back? It's bad enough I have to use these garbage computers for work. KILL THE EXTRA-WORK, POINTLESS TOUCH BAR. I'm not buying another MacBook Pro until they do.",
"Best Macbook yet. I've had many macbook pros. This would be my 4th one yet. I'm 24 and have been using them since 12 years old. I previously had a 2018 macbook pro 13 inch. All my other previous ones were 13 inches too. I got through high school, college, and now as a 3rd year post-grad student with 13 inch macbook. I was getting tired of working on a small screen and didn't want to always use my iMac to get work done, so I bought this one. It probably has more power than I need; the difference in power between this and the 13 inch is night and day. I've never been able to game on a Mac because poor graphics performance, but this one could actually qualify as a decent gaming laptop. It's so nice to have games to play wherever you are, and I have never been able to do that with Macs. The gaming performance is really good. I'll use Fortnite as a reference since it's used so much, but I can hit a solid 60fps on mostly epic settings, with a few high settings. I also downloaded bootcamp and got games like Sekiro, which play flawlessly on high settings. The only bad thing is the fan noise, which can get really loud any time you boot up a game or do intensive tasks. It isn't hot most of the time because the fans, which is good I guess for performance and longevity. But, I think they should find a better way to cool in the future though. There are some complaints that the fans are really loud even when simply connecting to an external monitor. It's not a deal breaker for me, but can be annoying at times. The speakers are vastly improved. Everything sounds so much better. It has great clarity, volume, and there's actually a little bass. I love them. Everyone knows about the keyboard. It's very nice. I had to get the keyboard replaced on my last one, but I shouldn't have a problem on this one. I never liked the butterfly that much. I like more travel personally. The screen is pretty big, which I like. Honestly, I think it could of been even a little bigger without much compromise, like a 16.5 or even 17. That would be perfect to me. But either way,16 is way bigger than the 13 inch I had. So overall, I think it's a great laptop. With the sales right now (it's $1999 on Amazon), it's actually a really good deal. I paid almost $1800 on my last 13 inch (the most comparable one now is $1699) and to compare them is like apples and oranges. Ok, the 13 inch wasn't bad at all, but this thing is a beast performance wise. And it has better speakers, new keyboard (new 13 inch does too), bigger screen, etc. Def worth $200-300 than a specced out 13 inch. If you are deciding between this and the base 13 inch pro or air because the bigger screen- if you can afford it I say go for it. You may like gaming on it and it's better in a lot of ways that I already mentioned. The other ones are still great, so if you're not keen on spending the extra cash you can't go wrong either way. So, if you're looking for a new macbook pro and want a bigger screen, power, and more, this is a great choice. If you want portability and don't need huge power, the Macbook Air is a great choice and $1k less than this- basically half the price.",
"Downgrade on older models. I have been using MacBooks for 8 years but I am disappointed with this iteration: - battery life is inferior to my ~2014 MBP - lack of standard USB ports leaves me carrying dongle(s) around, which don't always work reliably - lack of HDMI... more dongles - keyboard is poor and after just a year is constantly putting the ssame leetter twice when I type. I understand Apple will fix this for free but for $3k I shouldn't have to waste a day taking my laptop in.",
"Quite a few issues for such an expensive laptop. Updated review.. The battery life simply isn't what's advertised. For example, right now the battery is down to 22% in 5 hours with very little use. There are a number of apps open but mostly the computer has just been sitting idle. If I had been using the machine more during this time the battery would definitely have run down to 0%. The trackpad is supersensitive. There are often unwanted clicked that interfere with work. I've changed settings which has helped somewhat but the problem continues. Update: I thought I might adapt to this but now, after using the computer for quite a while, It's as frustrating as ever. Chrome doesn't function correctly. This is due to the computer, not to some problem with Chrome. As is too often the case, Apple simply doesn't keep up with software to ensure smooth functioning. For example their word processing program \"Pages\" has never been brought up to snuff, despite the initial hype. The syncing between phone and laptop is unreliable. The \"Photos\" app has various annoyances. Etc., etc. My long experience with Apple has taught me that the company is often aware of problems but will deny a given problem unless it becomes so widely known that they simply can't continue denying it. The net result is that the quality of Apple products is not often not what it should be. I recommend staying away from Apple products.",
"Hard Drive replacement is $1600. If you happen to purchase on of these just know that if something goes wrong with your hard drive the entire logic board needs to be replaced. The estimate to do the repair was 1600.",
"Broke a week after I got it. I got the MacBook Pro and literally a week after getting it the small bar at the top just blacked out forever. It still works but I cannot see what I am pressing. But then my computer started to randomly shut down every 30 minutes!!",
"From a 13in to a 16in Macbook. Love this thing. Initially was very torn between this and the 13in, and decided that the close price difference didn't justify the 13in when speced out. Very powerful, beautiful screen (almost indistinguishable from a high PPI 4k screen), amazing speakers, and more portable than I thought it would be. What surprised me the most was the battery life wasn't as good as I expected (even with 100Wh), but still very good. I initially didn't like how clunky the 16in felt in store (coming from a 13in). It took me all of one day to get used to the much bigger size- now I don't know how I dealt with that small screen size before. So yes, buy this thing, it should last and perform well for a long time.",
"Warning very loud. I've had mine for around 2 months now. It's connected to two external 1440p monitors. This thing will start going fan crazy at any time I do anything more than text. Download large files, watch youtube, etc. The cpu's never go past 10%. Very annoying. And it gets hot too. Performance is so so. Certainly not as good as I would like for the money. Build quality is excellent. Display is bright and crisp. Keyboard seems to be ok. I like lenovo better. No crashing issues, pretty stable.",
"Too short support for MAC OS. Apple has a tendency to take out support for still good computers from the latest Mac OSX. If you paid $4000 for a Mac then be ready to know that 6-8 years from the purchase date your mac will not be supported at all. The hardware used by Macs are, for a similar price, quite slower than if the same money were used to build a Linux/Windows machine. For example, Mac Pros 2012, with 32Gb of Ram and quad/six core processors are not supported any more by the latest version of Mac OSx and still those machines can do a lot of good.",
"Good with some caveats. I upgraded recently to this model of MacBook Pro. Overall, it is a good computer but I have two main gripes. The screen is hard to keep clean and despite following manufacturer recommendations, it is a challenge to keep screen from collecting smudges. Same goes for the keyboard. If you are the type to be anal about things like cleanliness of screen and keyboard, look elsewhere.",
"Ssd not user upgradable(not even talking about Ram). The laptop is designed to be obsolete in a matter a of a few years(depending on how long ssd will last). For a pro machine it\u2019s unacceptable to have no ability to upgrade ssd or ram.",
"MacBook Pro 16\" - Does not Charge and Dead in 6 weeks. I would like to share my worst experience with the \"MacBook Pro 16\". I have purchased new on August 25th 2020 from Bestbuy.com. With in 6 weeks from the purchase, laptop did not recognize the power supply and does not charge the battery. Eventually the laptop is dead. I can not access my data and laptop is just useless. I chose MacBook Pro because I thought the Mac products are best in quality and I do not need to worry about performance for many years. Worst experience is it took 10days to get appointment at Apple store for service, after visiting the apple store for service with hope of fix, they mentioned they can not fix in store and need to ship out for service. I have paid $29xx + $379 for Apple care. I did not get the quality for $$ I have paid. and lot of frustration with the process. Not Fair for Apple to charge premium price and provide the worst experience. With the price I paid for Mac I should have chosen different windows laptop with much much better configuration and they come home for service. Just think why we should pay about $3000 for this worst quality and experience? The more customers you make with this type of experience there starts the fall of Apple as company.",
"Welcome to Apple\u2019s Windows 98 World. I have this for work, gets way too hot, your hands start getting sweaty. Then it does like 4 random restarts per month, this is under high CPU load running virtual box. Don\u2019t buy this just buy a Windows box for 60% less than price of this POS.",
"Want to love it but. Ok. I bought this at Best Buy on Monday because the screen on my 2015 Mac book was cracked. I was just about to write and saw another review which was really similar. My 2015 refurbished at that) 15 inch Mac was perfect. The 16 inch is fine - for my log in to work / edit my kids videos stuff - is fine, but I\u2019m not sure what else to say. I\u2019m sure it is super powerful and all, but to date, just fine. Only thing I actually don\u2019t like is the massive trackpad - why so big? And no idea why all the reviews start with the keyboard - come on. That\u2019s not a reason to buy a computer. Anyway, I\u2019ll try my best to love it",
"Trivial to Break. If you even slightly crack the screen it goes completely black. I have no idea how my screen even broke. I woke up one morning and the display was completely black. It would cost ~700 dollars to fix the screen. The crack on the screen is difficult to even see. Of course, this is not covered in the warranty. In addition, my laptop had serious problems overheating. Buy a more durable laptop.",
"Apple products can be nice... when they work. I've been an Apple power user for almost a decade now. I've been impressed with the software, hardware and integration they've achieved in the past but those days appear to be over. Up until 2016, Apple had a pretty good run at being one of the best, if not THE best in the market at innovation. However, these days they seem to be plagued with a lack of innovation, hardware problems and constant software bugs. Are your Apple products working properly now? If so, don't upgrade anything. You're destined for a world of problems, pain and support hoola-hoops. From faulty keyboards to faulty wireless cards to dead pixels to software bugs to keychain issues to watch integrations breaking to phone integrations breaking. They're ALL part of the new Apple product lineups. Short of the story... if you thought your $4k worth of Apple products integrating nicely together was money well spent? You may be in for the frustration of a lifetime. Or, you might get all to work... IF it's all new and even then... you have about a 40% chance of problems. However, if you're upgrading any one of those things... be prepared to spend a LOT of time sorting through the issues. I warned you.",
"USB port. I am very satisfied with the function of my computer, I did not purchase this item off amazon I bought it at and apple store however due to no review on their website I came here. I was expecting to have a USB port on my computer but it seems apple just wants me to spend my mom on some attachment to use usb. If there is another way to use a usb without having to buy and attachment call me stupid and then tell me. I am also very dissatisfied with the battery life. If I take it off the charger for a couple minutes it'll be dead. However everything about the computer other then my two complaints I enjoy. The touch takes a little getting used to because I'm used to having a volume button right there for me to click. The graphics on the computer is top notch and my family comments on it every time they look at my computer. People tell you its really heavy but to me a 13 year old it's not that heavy.",
"High Quality Laptop. This is my 2nd MacBook Pro and it didn't disappoint. The keyboard is great, the display is bright and sharp, the speakers are definitely my favorite part of this new version of the laptop. Really great sound, like really great for a laptop. 16GB of RAM and the core i7 2.6 is plenty of power. The system never bogs down during tasks. I don't video edit or photo edit, or do anything very heavy, but for everyday tasks this laptop is plenty. I didn't go with the i9 because I don't do anything even close to needing 8 cores or the 1TB, and to save the $ made sense. So far very happy overall but it's only been a few days so I will update as needed.",
"Great machine. This is the most beautiful machine I\u2019ve ever had I\u2019ve had the MBP 17inch, 24inch iMac, 13inch MBP, and 13inch MacBook over the years the 13inch MBP still works fine and I\u2019ve had it 10 years since graduating college. I\u2019m a photographer and researcher and I decided to step away from Apple and purchased an MSI creator 65 4K 32GB 1TB SSD with a crazy high end graphics card and \u201cstate of the art\u201d cooling system to handle running taxing software like photoshop. That was in December 2019, after 3 weeks the cpu was constantly running at 90 degrees Celsius and consequently burnt the hell out of my thigh and I was only using Lightroom, so I returned it to get the 16inch MBP 16gb i9 with 1TB SSD I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have another machine that isn\u2019t made by apple, this is the highest quality you can get they have really cornered the market and this was about $500 more than the MSI but well worth it. I highly recommend. But if you have a lot of equipment that uses USB ports like me, don\u2019t forget the adapters like I did \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
"What a return to form by apple with the 16 inch MacBook Pro. I have the 8 core processor 2.4 GHz, 32 GB of RAM, 2 TB SSD, maxed out graphics card. Elegant and a beast. Pictured with 43 inch 4K monitor that Apple automatically configures with a plug in of one thunderbolt three. What a return to form by apple with the 16 inch MacBook Pro. Using with adobe creative cloud applications, some apps seem to need to be written for this processor architecture, although zero complaints with current performance. Battery life is great finally. The screen is beautiful. The increased cooling is evident. Overall I am overwhelmingly pleased. What a return to form for Apple. Only downside is this computer cost me north of $4000 with the three year extended warranty and accidental damage.",
"New Apple MacBook Pro (16-Inch, 16GB RAM, 1TB Storage, 2.3GHz Intel Core i9) - Space Gray. this is what we have been waiting for, awesome storage , fantastic keyboard, 4 C-USB ports and a port for ear phones, ear phones is for the tiny size plug . This is Just great for spreadsheets and photos! I like to have my music available and I loaded it up with 2,000 songs --it has awesome sound-- great speakers!! I have spent the evening playing with this gorgeous lap top - this is simply the best ever--get one you will be blown away---as I am",
"Garbage quality. MacBooks used to last years - my 10 year old one still functions, albeit very slowly. Now a days Apple has absolutely no quality control. Both of our MacBook Pros died a year after purchase. One of them was repaired for around $1000. The second one just sits there. I will never buy another Apple. I\u2019m advising all of my friends and acquaintances to stay away from their products. Both of us babied our machines. BTW, I had to conduct Zoom meetings, and I found out that the camera on a $2700 MacBook Pro is complete garbage.",
"Best MacBook ever made by Apple. Upgraded from the 15 Inch MacBook Pro, this new 16 Inch is a game changer, they got everything right except one minor thing the face-cam is still 720P they should have upgraded to a 1080P, this should not stop you, video is still good. The sound from this system is miraculous, like a high end audio system you have to hear it to believe it, the keyboard is great, Touch ID saves time. I bought my Macbook from a different Amazon seller Expercom. I needed more memory and more ram. My Mac cost $4200 :( expensive I expect this will be good for the next 5 years. I highly recommend.",
"It's good enough for Apple to sell. If you just use it as a laptop it works pretty good but if you need to use multiple external displays and need to plug in a bunch of gear that's when you'll start noticing some problems. If you populate all the thunderbolt ports there's no way to charge it unless you buy a dongle that has a charging port and multiple USB ports but the problem with those if you're using a very intensive program you'll start to notice battery drain while it's plugged in through a dongle (I have two and both dongles do the same thing one I paid $100 for and it still doesn't work). also when connected to external displays I've noticed a few system crashes and after owning 4 Macs (one of them was a hackintosh) I have never seen a mac system crash until this machine. Like I said performances great when you're just using it as a laptop but once I started hooking up my external displays I noticed a lot of thermal throttling so I had to buy a laptop cooling pad and that seemed to help a lot. All in all it's all right. it gets the job done I guess",

"Awesome Machine. The best MacBook so far. The speakers are a HUGE upgrade over the outgoing 15\".. one of the best I've heard on any laptop. The smaller bezels are also a very welcome upgrade along with the return to scissor switch keyboard. I can use the MacBook practically all day without plugging in as long as I'm not watching a ton of videos. Even then the battery life is pretty respectable. A month in and I genuinely don't have a single complaint other than the heat that my wallet is still feeling. Worth it though.",
"Too heavy!. The WiFi kept disconnecting after waking from sleep. Couldn\u2019t troubleshoot further. Besides the 16\u201d frame seemed a tad too heavy to carry as a day to day daily driver. Will suggest to go with the 13/14\u201d model.",

These are probably selling out like the AirPod Pros right now. A big thanks to Apple for this great machine which will probably last a very long time if I carefully take care of it as one should for something this expensive.",
"Started out good. I updated my computer and the screen then came out like this. So I\u2019m resetting the settings and sending it back to Amazon. I\u2019ve had this less than 7 days and haven\u2019t used it much. I guess I\u2019ll have to go to Bestbuy and pay the full price.",
"Non user replaceable ssd/ram.. The computer is not upgradable. Non user replaceable ssd/ram even the battery is glued tight to make replacement complicated.",
"That is a best laptop in 2020!. That is a best laptop for me now, I'am a senior javascript developer, and I use only this laptop, but I have previous model of this laptop and now want a buy new!",

"Too much stress!!!!. Battery life is 5-6 hours! You can\u2019t return it or you need to pay 15% of purchase + shipping! And they will not give you 18 months payment! You need to pay once and full price! Easier way to get MacBook from store only!!!!!",
"It's an Apple!. What can I say about a new MacBook Pro? Love everything about it including the new keyboard, refined touch bar, fingerprint sensor, separate \"Esc\" key and of course the 16-inch hi def display. This was a great value considering a similarly configured previous model actually costs more. The processing power is awesome for my music and video production tasks. Love it, love it, love it !!!",
"Very good laptop. Finally, apple made an awesome laptop. Super cool screen. Good keyboard. Good battery life. One of the best laptops I have ever had. I highly recommend.",
"LOVEEEE THIS COMPUTER. I got this as a gift and it is such an improvement compared to my 2014 MacBook Air. Everything works great and I haven't had any issues with my computer (it's been around 3 months). The only unfortunate thing is that my Touch Bar will occasionally be non responsive, sometimes one part, but when I restart my computer it typically fixes it.",
"Awesome. CRAZY quality and software, I love MacOS as someone who comes from Windows.",
"Awesome laptop. The best macbook pro apple has ever made!. Great laptop!",
"Switched from 2012 11\" Macbook Air. I purchased my new MBP at the beginning of the pandemic as a switch from a 2012 11\" MBA. Man oh man! The weight difference is hardly noticeable, the difference in the screen is amazing. Both in quality and in size the 16\" is amazing. Some people say it is \"too big,\" but to me it is really the perfect size. Thinking about getting a 13\" MBA or maybe the 12.9\" to supplement. I do occasionally hit the touch bar on accident, but that can be disabled if needed. I do like having easy access to certain shortcuts in various applications. Highly recommend the bump up to the 1TB hard drive over the 512. Kinda wish I had gone up even more on hard drive space.",
"That's the one!. The best computer if have ever used. Period. If you have important things to do, that's the laptop to get. The screen is incredible, I am a true fan of the new magic keyboard and the performance is out of this world with the crazy I9 setup. It just works. No driver crap or ads on the start menu. You may not like the price tag, but for sure! you get what you pay for.",
"Great machine. One thing I like about this machine is that the OS is robust that I've never saw any hanging.",
"Best Macbook in 2020!. I have a previous Macbook pro 16', yesterday i dropped it and it doesn't work well now, I want to buy the last one!)",
"Excelente notebook, acess\u00f3rios escassos. A m\u00e1quina \u00e9 excelente e compacta para o que oferece. O \u00fanico problema \u00e9 a escassez de acess\u00f3rios adequados ao tamanho (capas, carregadores etc).",
"A nota fiscal. A nota fiscal poderia ficar disponivel no site para casos de mkt place, tirando isso tudo ok at\u00e9 o momento.",
"Excellent. The new magic keyboard is awesome."]
