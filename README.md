# Amazon Aspect Extractor

## Project Description  

This project aims to extract and compile information about products on Amazon from their reviews.
Aspect Extraction and Sentiment Analysis are employed in order to compute statistics and summaries of products given their URLs.  

### Usage

#### Requirements
- Google Chrome
- pipenv (`pip3 install pipenv`)

#### Setup
Run `pipenv install` and `pipenv run spacy` to install all necessary packages. The program can now be run using `pipenv run main`.

#### Troubleshooting

There is an issues with "Are You A Robot" pages from Amazon preventing the crawling of reviews. In this case, a ValueError exception will be thrown while the GUI does not close automatically.

To override this, launch the program using `pipenv run debug`.

In debug mode the pages will be opened in the foreground and you get the opportunity to enter the image code of the "Are You A Robot" challenge.
We generally recommend copying the product URLs from the Google Chrome browser so that the corresponding cookies ensure that no "Are You A Robot" challenge will be triggered.
